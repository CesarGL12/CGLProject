"I need to come to NYC for work from Arizona almost 2 weeks a month. I usually get in on a Sunday or Monday night and I am warmly greeted by Maryam who does all she can to make sure I am comfortable in a room! She is fabulous! Throughout my many days at the hotel, Derron McBride who works concierge/front door always checks on me to make sure I am well taken care of and am made to feel like I am home while I stay with W. He is one of the top reasons why I keep coming back to the W rather than the hundreds of other options I have in NYC. He is the best!!!! :) If you stay at the W- make sure you say hello to Maryam and Derron- you will be glad you did. Kristi of Scottsdale, AZ",2
"Before watching this movie from beginning to end, I happened to just catch the last half hour. Ordinarily I don't watch a movie if I haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend had it on and once I started watching it I couldn't stop.I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. This is quite a funny movie (often gallows humor) , and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing. The monster makes Leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is a like a cross between a World War I German artillery vehicle and a giant coffin.A timid twenty-five year-old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married. His ex-best friend tags along and rags on him constantly. They're menaced on the road by a vintage black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks.I also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and I found those both to be interesting. I would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too, but I have so many other movies to watch I've never seen before....",2
"Positives :
Great care from the stewards
Comfortable Flight
Good Food and drinks
Negatives:
Nothing to be negative about :)",2
"We stayed here for one night following our cruise.
This place is very close to the airport and even offers complimentary shuttle service to the airport and the Light Rail station.
The hotel lobby area is nice and very modern. Room was a little out-dated, but comfortable. Loved trying out the Sleep Number Bed.
Would stay again.",2

"Leisure cooker delivered fast, great smooth transaction. Love my new cooker. Would shop with Hughs again next time I need a new appliance.",2
"This hotel is overprice!!!
To be honest is not worth spending the money. the food and all the is overprice and is not good. There is no coffee pot, the water cost 5 dollars for a little bottle. A glass of milk is 4 dollars. the staff is very rude and they don't know anything. the rooms are very small with no views. the pools are always closed when you want to go, or there is no towels.
The only people who are helpful are the hispanics that work there.",2
Arrived sooner than expected and it good condition,2
"Love, but quality only so-so
I really did love this sad and I still do, but after only one washing the pillow case they did and the sides don’t fold over anymore. It’s cool that they fold over in the first place and it looked very nice, but after one wash it kind of lost it shape",2
Vodka is definitely the star here! Every martini I have tried here is fabulous! We went once when it wasn't particularly crowded at the ice bar and our bartender put on a great show of serving our martinis even though we had all ordered something different.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone is the food. Their lobster salad is definitely one of my favorites on the menu! A little pricey? Perhaps! But well worth it!,2
"We had breakfast there and we enjoyed the views.We enjoyed the food, however we ordered omelette and they didn't tell us it didn't come with bread, so we had to order some bread after the meal was brought to our tables.Nice interior decorations, nice views, good service. We were the only customers at that time of day (10am), so I don't know how the service would be when it is crowded.",2
"Perfect for my daughter’s dorm room

"nice app, helpful and so many promo to get",2
"Pros: outstanding location, well-trained and personable front desk staff, polite maintenance staff, well thoughtout lobby with tons of workspaces for those of us traveling with laptops, $149 rate plus Marriott points and a flat screen HD TV in the room. Cons: small rooms and bathrooms, noisy heating system and street noise even on the 32nd level. The building is what it is; a 1970s hotel. Bathrooms have been updated with granite countertop, but the space is tight. For us the tight space was a worthwhile trade-off for the price.",2
"Great choice of batteries suitable for my car, furthermore, at a price that suited my pocket.
Quick delivery.",2

"This is the third phone we have bought over the past couple of years and the third time we have been impressed with the condition of the phone. The delivery wasn't very quick this time but that was entirely down to Royal Mail. Previously, delivery times have been very good.
Prior to this purchase we bought a phone from a competitor as the phone we wanted was not in stock with Envirofone but we had to return it due to the poor condition and not being as described.",2
"I go here so often, you'd think I would have reviewed by now. Zoolikins is a wonderful little baby boutique store!\n\nIf you are looking for cloth diapering, baby carrying or other granola child rearing necessities--this is the place. You can touch and feel a variety of diapers, take a class to learn how to use, pick up diaper safe laundry detergent, or just browse the variety of natural products available. The prices are pretty comparable to anything else you will find online, with the bonus of skipping shipping/delivery wait time. I love being able to preview my options and walk out the door same day with new \""fluff\"". Staff are friendly and knowledgeable without being to \""hover-y\"" while you shop. \n\nDefinitely put this store on your rotation if you are expecting or looking for a unique baby gift.",2
i feel totally suffocated by the fact that she wants me to protect her and still be this innocent little kid,2
"Gore hounds beware...this is not your movie. This little nail bitter has very little blood and guts. Its basically a version of Open Water that is effective and worthwhile. But what sets it apart is that we actually like the three leads (unlike Open Water) who find themselves up a tree when a crocodile flips their fishing boat and munches up their guide. We don't want any harm to come to any of them. SO when they start getting into dangerous situations...we actually care. Now I like killer animal flicks but I haven't been too impressed with Lake Placid up to Primeval (although I'm still waiting to see Rogue and hoping it is somewhere as good as this one!) but this little bugger did the job and did the job well. It's scares are creative and it only lapses into the run of the mill frantic crying sobbing and arguing for brief stints of realism so I never got annoyed. I remember reading the true story that inspired this where three guys went fishing and two ended up in a tree while their buddy was killed by the crocodile . But the thing that always impacted me that gets left out from the film was that the crocodile didn't eat up the buddy. No. For hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the dead body still in his mouth at the friends in the tree. Seeming to stay, if you come down here this is what will happen to you.",2
"My husband and I attended his very first Vietnam Veteran's Reunion at your resort November 8-12, 2012. We had a wonderful time! Your resort is absolutely beautiful - lovely tropical scenery and well kept grounds. The rooms are immaculate, and very nice - kitchen, sitting area, make-up/dressing area, patio with a knock-out view of the bay....
The food in your bar/lounge is fantastic- your appetizer pizza so yummy and large enough to feed four! The breakfast brunch is excellent - want to go back just for your made-on-the-spot mini waffles!
The hotel staff is super friendly and efficient and made us feel very welcomed.....can't wait to go back for another visit!",2
"After reading several reviews commending the Hollywood City Inn, we decided to stay there during a one niter visit to LA to see a Dodger game. Checking in was smooth, the desk mgr was courteous and the room was clean, although slightly worn. There is a pool, which we didn't use and it appeared clean. There is a U-shaped building around the pool and a seperate 2-story rectangular building with parking around it - this is were our room was. When we returned from the game, we took a shower, watched tv a bit and turned in around 12:30. There was only 1 lamp in our room, in a corner, that you had to get out of bed to turn on or off. At this time I heard someone in the room above us walking around. I could hear every footsep as the floor/ceiling creaked. Also, when they flushed the toilet above, you could hear the water rushing thru the drain in our bathroom wall. About 2:30 am I was awoken by footsteps above me...about 10-12 trips back and forth and about 6 flushes of the toilet!! Also, a couple men having a brief conversation in the hallway outside my room...sounded like they were in our room!! About 5:30 am, more footsteps from above and more toilet flushing.",2

"How have I not reviewed Carly's yet? Serious oversight on my part. \n\nCarly's is awesome. Let me make it clearer: AWESOME \n\nOh wait, you need to know why...Two words: JAZZ BRUNCH! They have live jazz music for brunch. Classy! \n\nOk so if you can't make it to brunch because you don't get out of bed before 4, then you must try their caprese sandwich which will make an amazing late lunch or early dinner. I seriously day dream about this sandwich. I like it even more than their smoked salmon with creme fraiche and capers - which is my brunch go to. Actually maybe it's a tie. I can't decide. \n\nI was here a week ago for first Friday and had their prickly pear margarita which was amazing! \n\nAlso their wait staff are all really nice and friendly and make sure you get what you need when you need it and they are super apologetic if they make you wait more than three nano seconds for anything, which is completely unnecessary but it's refreshing to hear because some other places I no longer frequent have horrible service. (I've withheld names to protect the innocent.)\n\nWhy are you still reading this? You should be going to Carly's.",2
"Had a pleasant experience here in this restaurant. Cozy ambience, friendly staff and tip top dining at an affordable price. Tried the Squid Ink Spaghetti, it was one of the best I’ve tasted so far.

"The Surrey is a classy hotel just a block away from Central Park. Staff and comfort levels were all first class. On our first night we had an unfortunate incident when another guest, either drunk or deranged but definitely naked, was knocking on our door. I called security and the hotel staff immediately addressed the situation and also upgraded us to a better room on another floor - they responded well. Both rooms we stayed in had views out the back onto services and air con units so this was disappointing but the roof garden, one of the reasons we booked this hotel, was also closed and under renovation. There is a nice bar and restaurant on the ground floor serving good quality wine. Forget the wine in minibar - I paid $28 for the worst sauvignon blanc I have ever tasted. All in all this hotel has all the right feel for Manhatten and has a great location apart from the small issues above we had a great stay..",2
"This was the 6th hotel we had stayed in on our trip to California. Where we travelled from San Francisco to San Diego, so had already booked this hotel (through 'Trailfinders') before I read the reviews, so was very wary on arriving at the Catamaran Hotel and was thinking that I would be very disappointed. However found it to be one of the best hotels we had stayed in! And definitely on this trip.
The reception and all the staff were very helpfull, and the reception area was very attractive with a waterfall and fish in the large pool.
Our 'standard' room was on the ground floor, with 'patio' doors overlooking the well kept gardens, where there were ducks and parrots. The room was very clean and spacious. And the furniture was in good condition (no knocks). The bed linen was expensive, being very soft cotton, and was changed every day, as well as the 4 bath and hand towels. The water in the bathroom was always pipping hot as soon as you turned on the tap.
Coffee was provided everyday in our room. The frigde was handy to keep fruit, milk and water
As a guest booked via 'Trailfinders' we had breakfast provided up to $40 per day per room. This covered a full cooked breakfast, freshly squeezed Orange juice, toast, jam and coffee. The orange juice and coffee were topped up. This kept us going till our evening meal!
The sun loungers and sun shades on the beach overlooking the bay were free to guests as well as Beach towels. This beach was swept early every morning.
Although we didn't use it, the swimming pool and jacuzzi was always clean and the furniture around the pool area was new and of a good quality. The hotel also provided towels for the pool.
The bar provded a 'Happy Hour' that was from 4.00pm-6.00pm, where the cocktails, wine and beer were half price.
There is also a boat the 'Bahia Belle' that is free to guests, and takes you to a sister hotel 'The Bahia' that lies across the other side of the bay and runs every hour from 6.30pm - 01.30am.
There were several conferences and weddings held on the 'South Beach' of the hotel whilst we stayed at the Catarmaran, but these did not interferre with us and what we wanted to. In fact they were a great source of entertainment, as we don't see these types of weddings in the UK!
We really wished we had booked for a longer period.
I would recommend this hotel and would definitelly return again if I returned to San Diego.",2

"Gary Busey is the title character, Frank ""Bulletproof"" McBain, your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes (38 and counting), he never stops going after the bad guys.When a cutting-edge U.S. tank dubbed ""Thunderblast"" is driven across the border into Mexico, it's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who's aligned himself with Russian villains. The Army personnel involved are kept as prisoners, chief among them Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who happens to be McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the Army for a rescue mission.Busey may not have the physical presence of say, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type, but he's a blast as a self- confident dude who's quick with the wisecracks. Fluegel is a great female lead; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and the always welcome William Smith (as a Russian major) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition. The supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman supply the script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran B director Fred Olen Ray. It's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know their material is absurd and cheesy, and just have fun throwing credibility out the window. Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions, and general all-out mayhem.""Bulletproof"" is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.7/10",2

i feel this assignment has been valuable to me in the way it has taught me more about the pacing of a film as the footage we had gave us so much more choice than we would have on a normal film,2
Brilliant service expert advice given.Will definitely be using in the future.5 stars,2
"This was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released. There are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. Actually, I do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common. Therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the DVD. Firstly, there was a theory about how naives our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers, specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre. This is the mutilation, the idea which gives coherence to the film; the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick the sensation was, when the monster rip Kurt's arm out. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes, no matter if the action is on a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper dressing room, and so on. May be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancée's head a more accurate work, made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting. Same thing with all action scenes, including the one of Kurt's arm. Furthermore, something could be done with the monster's make up. Some remakes have been good; I think in this case an attempt would worth while. Nevertheless, the black and white tones should be conserved.",2

"David Suchet,(Poirot),""FoolProof"",'03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to blot the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection! You could just view the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors through out the English countryside was simply breath taking. Megan Dodds, ""Bait"",2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy, wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from Mr. Poirot. A very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!",2
Very nice hotel and very nice stay. Even during hurrican sandy the service was excellent. Do not book a shuttle via the concierge. He advised us to leave at least 3 hours to early for the airport. Then the concierge changed the leaving time from 7 am to 6 am without us agreeing upon. He just left a message on our phone which we did not see timely enough.,2

"I'm here in Las Vegas for a one-week vacation and my young adult pastor at my home church in California recommended coming here for Sunday service. He had served here for some 10 years. My review is only based on my one visit, so take it with a grain of salt!\n\nThis place is HUGE. I've attended several megachurches in the past, but this is by far the largest church building I think I've been in, with plenty of parking to boot. Parking was pretty well controlled by volunteers.\n\nUpon entering, it was almost overwhelming. People milling about, a stylish cafe, tons of classrooms, and the huge auditorium/chapel. I think about 2,400 were in attendance at the 10:20 am service I went to.\n\nMembers of this church are super friendly, people wishing me a Happy New Year everywhere I went, including the sinks in the restrooms. Lots of families, looked like a pretty diverse demographic too.\n\nThe service itself was similar to other megachurches I've been to. Concert-style worship with an amazingly talented worship team on stage, dim lights, brightly colored spotlights, two large video broadcast screens with song lyrics overlaid on live video. Announcements were all done on video.\n\nThe sermon was presented by guest speaker Bill Butterworth of Southern California ( <url> who delivered a solid message with great foundations. I felt it was geared more towards newer believers (and service was also very short), but I don't mind that at all. The message was clear and easy to understand and remember, which is important.\n\nIf I lived in Las Vegas, I would probably put this church high on my list of churches to check out again and possibly become a member of! Highly recommended, especially for newer believers looking for a place to seek God and learn how to get grounded in the Bible. It sounds like there's a lot of ways to get involved with the church family too!",2

"Foodies say this is the best Thai restaurant in the US. This place has an overwhelming number of complimentary reviews so I won't over do it on this review. I will mention two things we ordered .....The crispy rice appetizer, Nam Kao Tod is amazeballs! This is not a typical fried rice that you find in any Asian restaurant, this is actually deep fried rice with a spicy, tangy and utterly delicious texture and flavor. I've never had anything like it. We also ordered (amongst a bunch of other superb dishes) the Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass. The fish was melt in your mouth, the flavors.....drool! This food paired with some sick German Rieslings made for the best 30th birthday dinner a girl could ask for. Way better than paying out the nose for a uppity dinner at a famous chef's restaurant on the strip. If your in Vegas and appreciate ethnic food, don't miss this place!",2
"After stumbling through various Japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, I've finally found a place that specializes at it. In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\nI started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.\n\nMonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. I wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but I could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.",2

"It was our first time at the Galleria Park hotel for my wife and i, and ended up extremely satisfied.we arrived very late but the reception was friendly and professional. Throughout our stay we experienced a very friendly and accommodating staff. Our king size bed was comfortable and the room was clean . The bathroom was small but the shower was great .Nothing is too ""top of the line"" and it was exactly what we like . Simplicity and good location.They make you pay for little extra stuff(water snacks and printer) but you can always get a cup of coffee in the morning and the paper. In the evening you can meet other guests during the hosted wine hour. we went right next door to Bread and Cocoa for breakfast.the location is awesome .less than 2 blocks from Bart .4 from Chinatown. Buses right around the corner and right in shopping area for the ones who like to do so. When we make it back to San Francisco ,Galleria Park Hotel will be be a top of our list to call first.",2

"For the most part the accommodation was good, but there was one glitch. We had been given a room that had not been cleaned yet or was still occupied. It was quite a sight and smell...whoever had been there had left the heat on high and food lying around that had since gone bad. I immediately returned downstairs...after driving around all day, my family was tired, and I was annoyed. I told the receptionist the matter, and though she was apologetic, she took three more customers before addressing me. After the room switch, everything was fine.
We chose this hotel, b/c we were traveling with our pets. And like all hotels in their chain, there is free wifi (good quality in our room), free parking, and of course, pets stay free. The location was alright for us, but we had a car. The nice part was that it was off of highway 59, so easy to get to Chinatown, the Indian area, downtown, the museum area, etc. Great value and a clean hotel that allows dogs. It's all I really need, and enough to overlook gaffes like the first night.",2

The bellman stored our golf clubs and they were ready for us for an early morning tee time. My husband and I were able to play on our own and got around the course in 4 hours and 15 minutes. We were never pushed nor were we held up on any hole. The course is interesting and in fabulous shape.
We liked the bar and the barman was very friendly. Our only disappointment in our stay was the Veranda Restaurant. We found the menu uninteresting. The minimum price for a bottle of wine is $45 and from there it jumped to $65. A bit steep for a casual restaurant.
I would definitely stay here again for a quick get-a-way. It's a bit isloted to stay more than a couple of days but is very relaxing and well maintained. I would definitely recommend it to couiples who like to golf (although I did not see any other women on the golf course) as a relaxing, romantic outing.",2
"For the most part my experience here's been nothing but good. But it's frustrating when you don't want to see certain content, that, you can't just hide it and it not pop up later on in your suggestions. Also it's extremely difficult to report fake accounts. I have a friend currently dealing with this and it seems that there's no way to get the false accounts that have stolen and copied her content.",2

"I stayed here for a few nights while traveling on business. I chose this hotel because of its proximity to my work location in northeast San Antonio, and because it's on a list of hotels that my employer requires me to choose from for business travel. Overall it's a nice hotel with typical amenities one would expect at a Doubletree.
Pros:
The hotel has a nice courtyard with lots of trees and a pool. Each room has a recycling basket. (First time I've ever seen that in a hotel.) The restaurant has a good breakfast buffet (not included in the rate) with bacon, sausage, made-to-order eggs, fruit, cereals, etc. Staff at the hotel and restaurant were friendly and provided good service.
Cons:
They offer a limited number (less than 20) of TV channels. My TV didn't work at all one morning. The room clock cannot be adjusted without a screwdriver. I've seen this in other Doubletrees, and it's annoying when the clock is incorrect. The hotel does not offer wireless internet, although high-speed wired internet is available for $10 per day.
I would stay at this hotel again when traveling to northeast San Antonio, mainly because it's the closest full-service hotel (that I can stay at) to my work location. Those wanting to visit downtown San Antonio should look elsewhere, unless convenient access to the airport is desired.",2

"En nuestro primer viaje en familia a San Francisco, el hotel cumplió con todos los requisitos: buena ubicación (a pasos de Market Street, con sus buses y tranvías); buen servicio (las habitaciones de buen tamaño, limpias y el personal atento); y precios razonables. Pensamos en repetir el viaje y no dudariamos de volver al mismo hotel.",2
"TUC is a new alternative transportation shop on McClintock, just north of Apache. Give them a call for their hours. I saw them one day while driving by, and stopped in to check it out. The owner was very friendly and we talked for a while. \n\nNow, I'm not a scooter person. I -could- be a scooter person in the future, but right now I'm a bike person (and a reluctant driver relishing the gas price increases). More specifically, a casual bicycle commuter. So I love the fact that TUC carries a whole mess of messenger-style bags...lots of Timbuk2, Manhattan Portage, and they're going to be carrying Chrome soon! They'll also be carrying some of Chrome's clothing (like the padded knickers, for those of us who need a little cushion but can't bring ourselves to flaunt it in spandex). I think this will make them the only place in the valley to get Chrome stuff. \n\nAlong with their scooter selection, they just got some cruiser bikes in. The owner, Pat, is very eager to bring everyone together and make his shop a community resource for bikers, scooter...ers, and everyone interested in alternative transportation (and alternative fuels). If you have a minute, stop by and chat with him, because I'm sure he'd love your suggestions and feedback.",2
"Beautiful and easy to install.
Very nice looking unit. Easy to install and instructions were pretty good. The only issue I have is that the unit I got is black the caps inside the unit are dark brown. I know small issue but I wished they would have matched because the brown sticks out like a sore thumb.",2

"Can't say anything bad about this please, and believe me I've reviewed some bad places before. I love 910 LIVE. \n\nI am a local concert photographer and shot A LOT. When I'm hired for a show at this venue I jump at the opportunity. \n\nIf you didn't know it was there, you'd probably miss it. But get off McClintock at 202 and headed a 1/4 mile north. It's on your left at the corner. The front is unassuming and mostly you'll end up going in the side door. This side door opens to the rear of the venue that is absolutely huge. It's essentially a concrete slab in the back with those hugh 10' tall shipping containers stacked on top of each other to make back walls. It's very cool. There is elevated seating all along one side where if you stand or sit you can see over the center floor crowd to the large stage. One of of this area has a bar that opens onto the back of the actual building. Beers are absolutely reasonable and they carry domestic and all local craft brews, too. Their whiskey is in line with many Tempe haunts (not the over expensive Scottsdale prices).\n\nI mentioned the stage because it's great. As a photographer I've been to some stages where the lights are so bad it is tough to even begin to shoot a show, but both the lighting and sound here are top notch. There is a large rigging that goes about 20' up behind and above the front of the stage so lighting is not an issue. The guy who runs sound here (may even own the place, he's white and bald) is an absolute perfectionist when it comes to his audio. It's always great.\n\nSometimes between bands on large shows, they do floor shows. They once had this art group of women with metals plates attached to bikinis, they danced around, and had metal grinders shoot sparks off their bodies. You are definitely in for a treat at 910 Live. \n\nI mentioned the outside stage, but there's also an inside stage. The two stages back up to one another so they can open this large garage door and move equipment between the two stages quickly. While the inside stage is much smaller, the lights are still good, and it's intimate. I've seen the inside totally packed and everyone loved the show. They just danced together as a big unit and enjoyed the show.\n\nBouncers are great and don't give me hassle when I need to move behind the rope to get side stage shots or even shots from behind the bands. They've always been accommodating and friendly, but they also run a tight ship and I've never seen anyone get unruly at this place. For the bands, they also have a \""green room\"" which is a green trailer that sits off to the side of the stage. Inside is a bank of theatre mirrors and a prep table, comfy couches and chairs, and a private bathroom with shower. Good area and good times completely at this venue.",2
"Are you kidding me? My second time here, first time was last year having tires bought off the internet installed! Great experience. But the reason for the review is what just happened. Pulled into my garage and heard the terriblr hissing of a tire leaking air and fast. Wasnt sure if I'd make it to Tireworks but I did. When I pulled in I jogged for the door and was intercepted by one of the technicians. I explained the problem and by the last sentence my tire was already off. Plugged it, rebalanced it and had it back on before the sleeping newborn woke up! Winning!!! Now for the price... Free! Gratis! zero dollars, nada, zip, bagels, less than 1 cent... you get it! I'll be back for all my tire needs. I realize this wasn't brain surgery or even a big repair but the way it was handled was clutch! I'm the newest Tire Works loyal customer.",2

"Don't stay here on the weekend unless you are ready for a sleepless night. We arrived on a Thursday for a conference and found the hotel clean, in a great location, reasonably priced and safe.
All that changed on Friday night. Apparently there was some track meet going on in Austin and all the hooligans decided to stay in our hotel. We were next door and across the hallway from some thugs who kept SLAMMING their doors all night. Until 4 am, they slammed doors, screamed, hollered, and partied it up. We called the front desk at least six times, and they refused to call the police for noise. We begged them to do so, but they refused, stating something lame like 'we need a warrant' which is an utter and total falsehood. Refusing to provide us with service is the reason why I will never stay here again. Not only that but there was vomit in the elevator and on the lobby floors when we checked out.
I realize it's not the hotel's fault that people were noisy but the way they dealt with it was poor. They should have kicked the offending parties out.",2
"First and foremost, I have to preface this review by stating that I have high expectations, so when I say that Stephanie is fantastic, please know I don't use that term lightly. It was my first time at Dolce and I was nervous about a new person cutting my hair. I told her the style I wanted, I showed her a few pictures and voila, she executed my haircut perfectly. Stephanie not only has the skills, but she is peppy, precise and loves color! When I told her I was indecisive on hair color, but wanted a new color, she spent time with me after my cut discussing possible colors. Plus as an added bonus, she didn't push product on me!! I just hope her schedule doesn't fill-up before I can make another appointment! \n\nOn Dolce itself, it's shiny and sparkly and filled with people to help you and answer your questions. Plus, all of the level 3+ hair dressers have assistants, who are there training for 7-12 months on cutting, coloring, and how Dolce works. I was extremely impressed to hear that Dolce doesn't just let anyone on the floor and that they obviously take pride in the men and women who represent their company.",2

"Best Italian food I have EVER had. And the ambiance gets a high rating too. Service was also great. It was more than a $50 cab ride over here from the strip, but so so so worth it. If you are visiting Vegas, it would really be in your best interest to make it here. Oh, and you must try the cheesy garlic bread appetizer.",2

"I loved the movie, but like everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still...I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.Then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' character didn't do it, but I can see how that could be confusing. Also, why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.Apart from that, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she's a GREAT actress.Also, I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure...",2
I have been a food fight customer and visit all of there restaurants on a regular basis. My favorite is Monty's blue plate. The meatless loaf of the gods is my favorite. Have tried other things and have always been happy. Every year they sell gift certificates and for every one hundred dollars they give you a twenty five dollar certificate. Can't beat that. I load up a gift card with five hundred and eat all year. I would never agree with the people that have bashed their places. Try it you will like it.,2

"I've stayed in NYC quite a few times now, but the Gansevoort Hotel has to be the best to date. It truly defines service with a smile - all the staff were so kind and would bend over backwards for us. Rooms are large and delightful with a generous collection of amenities and fantastic views.
Kevin Costner and the Black Eyed Peas were amongst guests during our stay, and I think that says is all - you're in good company when you stay with the Gansevoort.",2

"He estado cuatro días con mi pareja para conocer Manhattan y asistir a algunos musicales. El Hotel está muy bien situado frente a la catedral de San Patricio, junto a la quinta avenida, así que es perfecto para el turismo ya que está en una zona muy céntrica y segura, bien comunicado, y se puede ir andando a Broadway o a las mejores tiendas. La habitación era grande y las vistas excelentes. La decoración era noble, en madera, quizá demasiado clásica y un poco pasada. El baño era cómodo pero no tanto como el de un buen hotel europeo. El precio medio por noche fue de 325 dólares y por ese precio hay hoteles magníficos y modernos en muchos otros sitios pero, claro, no están en medio de Manhattan. El servicio era atento, especialmente los conserjes que nos facilitaron todo lo que necesitábamos. El hotel era silencioso, pero el aislamiento de las paredes muy pobre. Probablemente, en Nueva York, es un gran hotel pero no creo que vuelva a hospedarme en él.",2
"Best one
Very reliable, I had no problems whatsoever! I love this product its 100% amazing quality! Very Happy!",2
Daniel just came to our house and was very kind and courteous. He was running at little late and was very apologetic. I discussed the situation and he listened to me with interruption or making any assumptions. He trouble shot the unit and discussed pricing as we went along. I will definitely be recommending them again and be using them in the future. He was super fast too! In the end he discussed the billing and didn't even use freon after cleaning the coils and rechecking the system. As a contractor in another trade I appreciated every aspect of the service call.,2

"Coonskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi film. Like the best of his work, it's in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second, but unlike some of his other work (even when he's at his finest, which was before and after Coonskin with Heavy Traffic and Wizards), it's not much uneven, despite appearances to the contrary. Bakshi's taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race, of course, but moreover he's making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film; blaxploitation almost, though Bakshi doesn't stop just there. If it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature. But Bakshi's aims are higher: throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but Italians/mafioso, homosexuals, Jews, overall New York-types in the urban quarters of Manhattan in the 70s, he isn't out to make anything realistic. The most normal looking creation in looking drawn ""real"" is, in fact, a naked woman painted red, white and blue.In mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism (i.e. the ""tar-rabbit, baby"" joke, yes joke, plus black-face), we're looking at abstraction to a grand degree. And best of all, Bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously, unlike Spike Lee with a film like Bamboozled, in delivering his message. This is why, for the most part, Coonskin is a hilarious piece of work, where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and, of course, scenes of awkward behavior (I loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real-life white couple in tux and dress as looking ""colorful"" and the like), are just too much not to laugh at. It's not just the imagery, which is in and of itself incredibly ""over""-stylized, but that the screenplay is sharp and, this is key for Bakshi this time considering, it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness.Using at first live-action, then animation, and then an extremely clever matching of the two (ironically, what Bakshi later went for in commercial form with Cool World is done here to a T with less money and a rougher edge), Pappy and Randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape, and Pappy tells of the story of Brother Rabbit, who with Brother Bear and Preacher Fox go to Harlem and become big-time hoodlums, with Rabbit in direct opposition to a Jabba-the-Hut-esquire Godfather character. This is obviously a take off on Song of the South with its intentionally happy-go-lucky plot and animation, here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is.Yet Bakshi goes for broke in combining forms; animated characters stand behind and move along with live-action backgrounds; when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975; when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black-face and a dress, he trips in a manner of which not even Disney could reach with Dumbo; a boxing match with Brother Bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow-motion; archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies, some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless.Like Mel Brooks or Kubrick or, more recently, South Park, Bakshi's Coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought-provocation second. It's also audacious film-making on an independent scale; everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters (however all based on the theme of the piece) all serve the thought in the script, where its B-movie plot opens up much more for interpretation. To call it racist misses the point; it's like calling Dr. Strangelove pro-atomic desolation or Confederate States of America pro slavery. And, for me, it's one of the best satires ever made.",2

"This place is well worth the cost of admission ($18.00 for adults and $12.00 kids under 17 years)! If you have time to spare (maybe 3-4 hours), you will learn alot about mob history, everything from it's origins, law enforcement tactics, it's effects on Las Vegas, the key players, and so much more. We were absolutely fascinated with the level of detail regarding all facets of the mob. The museum is well put together, which keeps you engaged. There are films, interactive activities, and great artifacts that make visiting an interesting experience. This is a must see for all who are mafia movie buffs and interested in mob history.\n\nThere is so much to read, we actually stayed for a few hours, left and came back (admission is good for the entire day).",2

"This show has come so far. At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. They stuck with the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go down swinging, get one last punch in. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on Friends, and let the finale be huge. I say get Donna and Eric married, I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best!10/10...",2

You would be surprised how few people do not speak to children when they work at kid themed venue. \n\nOne wish for improvement would be food service level. We just ordered pizza and cheese bread.

"An A380 was waiting for us at the gate on the Sunday morning flight from London.
The plane had been recently upgraded with the latest seating in business class which, at over 6ft 4in, is extremely important - even in business class.
With the new seating arrangement the extension to allow a full flatbed is now well designed as it allows you to lay in a straighter (in line) position that the previous arrangements - where you were bent off at an angle and, at my length, ended up in an S configuration! - failed to achieve.
The only niggle was that the control panel by the side of the seat was very sensitive. When I bent forward in the seat to pick up a newspaper from the pocket, the panel would set the call button off and move the seat! Very annoying - not only for me, but for the crew!
The flight took the new course down to Singapore - missing the troubled areas in the Middle East.
As usual the staff on board were first class and the trip was trouble free.
Importantly, which people normally forget to mention, the bags were out in the baggage claim area very quickly. Another plus for SIA travel in Changi.

"My husband and I stayed here for a night out on Dec. 29th. Requested and received a room on a high floor, with a nice view of the city. We stayed in a studio suite, which was perfect for our needs. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but I'm not sure how we would have received our luggage if we had not gone back to the valet area and picked it up ourselves. When we arrived, we left our bags with the valet, who said he would bring them up. (You have to go up to the second floor to check in.) So we left them there, and when we checked in, mentioned it to the clerk, who then asked for our receipt. Unfortunately, we had not been given one, (just our parking ticket.) He said not to worry about it, but I went down and retrieved them anyway. Not sure how they would have matched my bags to my room. The carpet in our room was just a little dark and dated, but the room was clean, and bright otherwise. Bathroom facilities were adequate, nice shower. I was a little frustrated that the coffee pot in the room made only one cup at a time, and we were given only enough regular coffee for one cup. (The other packet was decaf.) The room was quiet, only heard a siren once in the night from the street level. It also had a nice couch/chaise for reading and relaxing. I would definitely stay there again.",2
"A short walk from our hotel we discovered this gem. We were greeted in such a friendly way. Our waiter explained the menu and gave his recommendations, then left us to decide.

"Last week, May 18th to the 23rd, was my third or four stay at this hotel. It comes up quite often in Priceline at reasonable rates. For your money you get a nice, comfortable room in an excellent location just steps from a subway stop. The hotel, however, has enough quirks to bother some travelers.
Last week, no ice machine worked anywhere in the hotel. If you wanted ice in your room you had to travel to lobby and ask for some at the bar (if open) or the Restaurant (if open). On Sunday night and without prior notice the water was shut off and we went to bed without the requisite shower. In addition, the TV selection is a bit skimpy with no CNN. I have never been to any hotel anywhere during the last 10-15 years without CNN access. Water pressure in the shower is poor and the shower lining was a bit dirty. Little things all of these but they were there. Caution to the wary.",2

"Perfectly located at the heart of busy Georgetown, but peaceful in the hotel. Staff very welcoming, courteous and helpful in all parts of the hotel. Rooms smart and well furnished. Nice air of faded elegance about the place - the feel of a boutique hotel rather than a chain. Terrific breakfast, all served at your table - no buffet!! Would defintely come back. Minor complaint: bathroom very small, washbasin cracked, shower door wouldn't close so water everywhere, plug on washbasin wouldn't shut. But overall a great place to stay.",2
"Arrived and was not assisted with luggage out of cab, instead struggled to get into the lobby with 2 people in tow. Our room was a good size and hotel is in good location, about 1 block from South Station Subway. Paper-thin walls could hear conversations, phone calls, TVs, cleaning crews and the 5am wake up calls that our neighbor requested. Was never asked if we were satisfied with our stay. I think for the cost of our room a free wifi signal would not have been unreasonable. Just disappointing for the price and expectation from what I thought would be a great stay.",2

"What a pleasant suprise. We had read mixed reviews about this one but we were happy. The location is fantastic, close to everything. You can walk to get the ferry to Alcatraz, to see sea lions at pier 39, to the cable car, to the crooked street and a bus stops just near the hotel to the city or to the baseball park. The breakfast was fine, yes it was crowded but we always got a seat for 5 and the food had never ran out when we were there. San Francisco is an expensive place to eat so great to fill the kids up before heading out. Front desk were helpful and able to tell us about buses etc that we needed. Room was bigger than we had expected.",2

First off, I think what you are really paying for is location, which is great--right next to Grand Central and within walking distance of a lot of NYC attractions. Also good was the lovely lobby, which has a little shop that sells yummy sandwhiches, drinks etc.
However, there were a few negatives as well. There was a mix-up with our reservations-we had a number of rooms which we booked online to be on the same floor, so the whole family could be in the same part of the hotel. Ahead of time we were told this would be no problem. When we arrived we found this was not the case. This to me wasn't that big a deal, but what was a real hassle was the front desk staff, who tried to switch things, then couldn't, then said they could, then gave away some of our rooms by mistake, then tried to fix that, all while giving us the run around. It took much longer than necessary to sort out (hours), and I could tell the staff really didn't care one way or the other about fixing things. So if you are looking for great service don't come here.
Also the many reviewers who said the rooms need updating are correct. I was surprised, after seeing how lovely the lobby was, that the rooms were really just average, outdated, and a bit on the small side (bathroom was tiny). However, we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway, so if you are looking for a simple base of operations, it serves its purpose. Did have some street noise and noise from other guests walking down hallways, etc. while trying to sleep, so I'd say it needs some soundproofing too. Also made the mistake of going to the bar one night and two drinks cost $30, which I thought was ridiculous, even by NYC standards. Overall I'd say the experience was average--not great and not terrible. It's up to you if you think the great location balances out paying a bit too much for a really average room and no-frills service.",2
im still feeling that way um not respected that is not cryptic and convoluted with the added dose of thems that did respect my work are recently dead and its that time of year when we mourn our dead and so now its all a churn in my head and my solar plexus,2

It's the first time I've shopped with you guys in years. This totally due to my life and not the store. While the guy who served us was spot on he did I felt lacked a full understanding of the the kit I was looking at. H was good but just stumbled at a couple of questions. I would have really preferred he had asked one of the other members of staff or looked it up. As I say my experience was really good it could have been great.,2
"When we arrived, we weren’t sure what to order but the owner was really helpful and talked us through the dishes and showed us pictures on an iPad. We decided on the kapitan chicken, beef rendang, a vegetable dish that you roll in lettuce, another chicken dish that I forgot the name of and a seafood soup. Everything was so tasty and piping hot- no wonder the reviews are so good. Thank you trip advisor- we would probably never visit the more traditional places without being able to read the reviews first!",2

Durante il nostro soggiorno era anche attivo un servizio Limousine gratuito per raggiungere tutte le destinazioni più lontane (poche).

"Soft, thick, good adhesive. Easy to cut to shape.
There is not much to say about felt table-leg pads. They are soft enough and thick enough to protect my wood floors. The adhesive is sticky enough to adhere well to the flat base of the table leg, and i had to put one over a sightly-protruding nail, and it still seems to adhere and protect well. The large squares can be easily cut with strong scissors, though a box cutter is easier.",2

But i had a deal to stay here for a couple nights and i was pleasantly surprised when we got in. The reception area is BEAUTIFUL! and the rooms are so cool. It's an old hotel but has been very well kept. Awesome old features throughout the whole hotel.
The location is so perfect too. our view overlooked the park. it was awesome! i would def stay here again and i tell all my friends and family about it.",2

I'm a sucker for dolmades.\n\nIf you want a light atmosphere in a cozy restaurant and the finest Greek food in Southern Wisconsin, go to Atlantis Taverna.

So the front desk decides to put me in a standard room (not my reserved studio suite) without informing me and waited to find out if I should complain, to put me into the room I paid for! Needless to say she had to upgrade my room to make up for it. The rest of the staff and my stay was OK and uneventful but what she tried to do still leaves a bad tast in my mouth.",2

"I booked this hotel while sitting in the airport prior to leaving for NYC, based on reviews online. Believe me, this spot does NOT disappoint!
ROOMS: Our room was the cheapest available at booking. Upon check-in, we were given a free one-step upgrade. The room was small but well stocked. The iPads used to contact guest services were a GREAT feature....very easy to use! The bed was extremely comfortable and well-tended each day by the staff. The best feature of the room was the bathroom/vanity, which made every hygienic chore a pleasure to engage in!
FACILITY: The hotel doesn't have, to my knowledge, a pool or business center or conference area. It definitely doesn't seem geared to business travelers or large families. For locals or couples, though, it's perfect. While we did not partake of any food at the restaurant on site, it was always crowded, as was the lounge & bar areas. The lobby was spectacular. Also, the hotel was QUIET - a luxury in downtown Manhattan! Our room was directly in front of the elevator doors and we never heard a bump, bedsprings, honking horns or street noise. Very serene.
LOCATION: 2 blocks from Times Square, 3 from Grand Central station. 44th Street was never super busy, which was nice when walking as tourists & street vendors weren't an annoyance. There are plenty of small restaurants in the area, and great shopping only a couple blocks to either side! Also, LOTS of taxis...the plethora of hotels on this row meant you never had to wait to grab a ride.
STAFF: Super attentive, super friendly. Concierge services were knowledgeable and helpful, and the only problem we experienced our entire stay (iPad wasn't configured properly) was fixed in under 5 minutes directly from the front desk. You can't beat that.
SUMMARY: If you're here with a bunch of kids or need business amenities on-site, this location won't be your best choice. For local travelers, couples or singles on vacation, this is a fantastic hotel with a great value!",2
"We had tickets to the theater and decided to make a day and night of it in downtown Chicago. We were very pleased with our decision to make the Blake Hotel our place to stay during this visit.
Maggie checked us in at the front desk and was very welcoming and helpful. We checked in a little early and were pleased that we were not forced to wait for our rooms. She was very helpful in helping us choose a restaurant and giving us ideas for activities in the city.
The rooms were beautiful--they were all recently renovated and looked like an upscale boutique hotel. The beds were very comfortable and quality linens were used. The showers were spa-like and I like the large size of the bathrooms with the double sinks which make it easier for more than one person getting ready.
We had dinner at the Custom House next door. The food was good and the service was excellent.
Having a complimentary breakfast was a nice treat. Corey made sure that we had everything that we needed--very appreciated!
We would definitely say at this hotel again and recommend it to a friend.",2

"We had a very nice stay in Hilton..the room was good and facilities at the hotel are also good, except for $32 for parking fees..I can recommend people to stay in this hotel..
The only strange things that happened was that we went to Aqua to have our dinner, as we are vegetarian, we asked for Veggie burger..The waiter went inside to find if that is available, and cam back and told us that they do not have that in their rstaurant..because of which we had to order mushroom risoto..which was anyway horrible..Then the next night we again went there, and inquired about the veggie burger and this time the waiter told that they have it..we asked him, how come the waiter ealier night didnt know about this, and his answer was that , as he is also vegetarian, he knows about it..wow..that 's the funniest line I ever heard from the waiter..",2

"We stayed here for just one night because it is very convenient to the airport.
The problem is that it was a Sunday night. We arrived just as a weekly Sunday afternoon club/dance/pool party was ending. Could hardly drive to the front as the entry drive was full of 20 somethings who did not care if cars were trying to enter and the staff who were present did nothing to help the situation. Once inside, the lobby was so loud we could hardly hear the receptionist. As we rounded the corner to the elevator there was a young bikini clad woman with her hand down the pants of a shirtless guy, and the staff member we were following did not even blink. The elevators were full of loud partiers hurrying off to their rooms. I felt so awful for the father trying to cover his kids eyes and the elderly couples who were also staying there. However I think the few businessmen were probably enjoying the view. This is all fine I suppose but not really appropriate for a hotel trying to market to families and businessmen,
After all that taken into account, still not that nice of a hotel. The doors in our room were all beaten up, the carpets had bleach stains, and the light switches had gunk accumulated on them. Signs that this place is in desperate need of a refurbishment,
Trying to find something positive... the hotel staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. And it's a great location if need someplace close to the airport.",2
"This place is amazing. I have yet to have something there that I did not love and I have been there plenty of times.\nThe food and experience is wonderful, there are plenty of meat and vegetarian options on the menu and the way it is served will make everyone happy. \nThe food is brought to you on a plate on top of injera, a flat, spongy, moist bread with a taste similar to sourdough. Pieces of injera are torn off and used to scoop/grab bites of the portions, no silverware. They have traditional Ethiopian drinks and liquor, too.\nThey have lunch specials where the portions are served wrapped burrito style, which was my first experience and absolutely amazing.\nCafe Lalibela is a must, something wonderful to experience, a delightful culinary peek into another country and culture. You won't be disappointed.",2

"I came to this place for dinner buffet over labor day weekend wtih my family and everything was delicious! I had been to other buffets in Vegas but it was my first time here. The others I had been to were okay, nothing amazing, but I will definitely say that this one is now at the top of my list. \n\nSurprisingly, we arrived at 7pm on a Friday (of a holiday weekend) and only had to wait 25-30 minutes to get seated. That was awesome because I was STARVING. Upon walking inside, I was already overwhelmed by all the different food options. I ended up trying as much as I could and honestly liked pretty much everything I tried. They have a huge range of things to choose from- soups, sushi, tacos, oysters, crab legs, fish, meats, etc. I personally tried a few of the chef special hot dishes and liked them a lot (although I don't know what they actually were). The ox tail soup they had was also perfection, along with the mushroom truffle soup. Aside from the main options, they also had a humongous assortment of dessert- macarons, cakes, pastries, crepes made to order, and gelato! I ended up sharing with my brother and essentially trying a bite of everything. I'd definitely recommend doing this if you have expand your stomach enough to do so ;).\n\nIn the end, I walked away feeling super full and regretting my life decisions (like eating that last mousse, or going to buffets in general)... but after recovering from that, I'd definitely go again because I just can't pass up all the deliciousness that is there :P. This is most definitely my favorite buffet on the strip.",2

"My family and I are so happy we found DHC. My husband and I come from different religious backgrounds: I was raised as a Catholic and he was raised Born Again Christian. I hadn't gone to church for over ten years and didn't really plan on going back. Then, my four year old told me, \""Mommy, I want to go to church.\"" Like all parents nowadays I decided to totally let my child run my life and dictate where we go....ok, ok not really he did say that and he and I had a discussion about what he thought people did a church (sing songs and eat cookies) and what went on there. It really got me thinking about spirituality and religion and such. \n\nSo, I started the search for a church. I was looking for a church in which my whole family would feel comfortable. I was looking for some place that was open to all and did not discriminate. I was also looking for a church that did not make me feel like I had to either send my child away or sit in an enclosed place so the adults could worship in peace. I started my search on-line and went to several churches websites. I found one that seemed to meet all the criteria, but I was skeptical. I figured we'd give it two services and then try another and then another and then eventually just give up and go back to sleeping in on Sundays. \n\nFrom the moment I walked in I felt like this was a different kind of church. The people who greeted us at the front door were so friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy we were there. Pastor Paul gave a sermon that I felt was very relevant to me and what was going on in the world. I felt very comfortable and so did the rest of my family. We never ended up going to check out other churches although it did take us several months to decide to actually commit to DHC, not because we were unsure, but because it seemed like such a huge commitment and I didn't want to jump into anything. The DHC members we have met are so nice and caring. It's a church that takes God seriously but not themselves. So, if you are looking for a church that is inclusive of everyone and feels like a place you are wanted and cared about. I highly recommend Desert Heritage Church. \n\nP.S. They did have singing and cookies",2

Highly recommended !",2
"We stayed here in November of last year. Firstly the location is perfect and there is no need to use the subway or taxis for access to 5th Ave, shops, Central Pk, etc.
The Hotel was once owned by Leona Helmsley, the Queen of Mean- so interesting for that reason alone.
The Hotel was once a private mansion owned by a railway mogul and the bedrooms have been added in a rather boring tower at the rear.
Th interior of the mansion is incredible, this now houses the public areas and the wonderful restaurant ""Gilt"" as in gold. The original architecture is quite breath-taking and the modern furnishings compliment the original very well.
The rooms are spacious and well appointed, reception is efficient, the concierge is pleasant & informative and the servcie staff are OK by NY standards.
The Executive Lounge is very good and has great views of St. Patricks Cathedral, & the Breakfast is particularly good!
Overall I would recommend.",2

It is a simple yet delicious snack that you can have after dinner. The stall is located just outside a home and opens from 6pm-10pm, from Monday to Saturday and closes on Sunday. Try to be there early to avoid disappointment.. I was there when there, there were customers who arrived like 10mins before 10pm and all the putu piring were already sold out..",2

"We stayed here in May and it was great. We saw the rating on TA and after comparing price, location and amenities online, we decided to stay at Trump. We were willing to pay a little more to be comfortable and enjoy our leisure stay. Our room was huge. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was great and very modern. We loved the turn down. It was nice t come in to bed turn down, nice music playing. Room service was pricy but we expected that. The food was good and they were prompt. We were there about a week and they called us by name when we came down stairs. The concierge were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Location was perfect. We walked every where. No rental needed. You have to go to the gym and the spa. Even if you not going to do spa services, take the tour. Check out the showers in the gym. If you're toning to stay here, you might as well enjoy the rest of the hotel. I have no complaints. We loved it.",2
"Heading to Sam Boyd stadium in need of some food. Read the reviews for this taco place and we were all so glad we are here. The food was yum! Nice clean, quick Mexican food.",2
i wonder how it feels to be loved by someone you love,2
"Central location, we enjoyed stunning views of New york library from our large window. Staff helpful, friendly and attentive. Thanks in particular to Joe and Amanda who went the extra mile in making us feel welcome. Most comfortable bed, room spacious, chic and very clean. It is a lovely hotel and we will most certainly visit again, excellent",2
I arrived early and was able to go to my room and rest prior to my appointment and when I had to leave I had a late plane and was aboe to check out late with no problem the staff was great.,2
"After several satisfactory visits in the past, my week long visit this time was a disappointment. I reserved a suite, which was roomy, however the sofabed was in terrible condition. Seat cushions were flat. On day 6 I was suddenly asked to move after being told my suite had been pre-booked. My reservations had been a month prior and I was not advised of a booking conflict when I checked in. I had to cancel plans in order to be available to move my things when the replacement suite was ready. No apologies and no ability to speak to management about this. During the last night of my stay, there was a loud scary domestic dispute in the room next to mine which I had to report to the clerk. When I checked out, I was handed my bill with no reference to my issues. I wrote to the management requesting some form of compensation or at least an apology. Nothing. I have since sent an email but have still heard nothing. I cannot find out who the owner of the hotel is other than it is part of the Pacific Hotel Group but owned and operated independently. I would caution visitors about this hotel's poor customer service.",2
"I recently stayed for two nights at the Westin and had a very nice visit. The updated rooms were very nice after a day at Cobo. The hotel has all the amenities you need for a nice stay. The location is great if you are attending an event at Cobo, or anything else downtown Detroit.",2
"I was in New York to move my daughter into her residence for school for the summer. It was a great location in Midtown. Rooms are large enough and very clean. Check in staff were friendly and very helpful.
Valets were also excellent as we had are car and we were moving in and out a lot and the car was brought up very quickly. Lounge was lovey and staff were very nice. Overall stay was wonderful and we had everything we needed. Great location easy to get around the city on foot or by car.Would come back anytime.",2
"Took Singapore airlines and paid £11 each way for ordinary aile seat. Plane was 777_300.i requested for aile seat. Normally it is free..Dont recommend what i had done.
The flight was very good,food and service is good. Flight very reliable.i recommend taking Airbus 380.
Crew are good, helpful and supportive.
Overall.....good",2
"Great back lights
I used them around my mirror in my room. I did have some difficulty getting the connector to stay plugged in but once I moved the power strip closer it stayed plugged in and worked great. I would definitely repurchase",2
4 stars only because there's no feature to see who liked your playlist.,2
"I’ve never been a Carphone warehouse customer before. However today my phone suddenly wouldn’t charge and I went into the Kingswood, Bristol store and asked for help.
The customer service by the two gents and lady was superb, never asked where I got phone from, just tried to help me.
Transpired thanks to their help that it was a faulty cable, so I bought a new one (although it’s pink care of my son!)..... the service I had today would make me keen to buy bigger purchases in future, thank you Kingswood team.",2
"Thank you for yet another enjoyable stay at the Hampton Inn. I arrived at around 11.00 prepared to drop of my bag prior to hitting the streets of NYC, but the very nice girl on reception said if I would like to wait 10 minutes my room would be ready, and it was. Great, comfortable rooms with ample space. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds are very comfortable after all the walking entailed in a day in New York. I love the location of this hotel - just across the road from Macy's and close to the subway and good bars and restaurants. The breakfast also really sets you up for the day!",2
"This wasn't the first place I had sushi when I moved to Vegas but its now the only place I'll have it!! I started coming here a couple of years ago and now its tradition. I love the AYCE its totally worth every penny starting with the edamame and ending with the Mochi. Every time we come here we try a new roll and have all our favorites, I am a huge spicy fan and my boyfriend like the milder ones. My all time favorite is the Are You Ready? But he prefers the Tiger Yamazaki, they are always the first things we order and sometimes we end the meal with a second one each. I love the 911 and wish i could top all my rolls with that crunchy topping and eel sauce! now onto the service, We have a problem at most places we go because my boyfriend typically drinks 6-10 glasses of water with every meal and most servers are never on top of his refills but not here... They have someone that specifically is for refilling drinks and clearing plates so as soon as you pick up your last piece of sushi your plate is being picked up and our glasses never get under half full!! Sometimes the wait staff can be a little overwhelmed with tables but you never have to wait too long to order your next rolls!! It's a small restaurant but not as small as some sushi places I've been to in town, and defiantly worth the wait if you have to hang out for a few minutes before your table is ready. Plus you can't help to enter and leave with a smile since they greet everyone the second the door opens and say a farewell every time you exit!!",2

"I grew up sprinting across University Avenue every summer morning after swim team to stuff myself with Bagels. The delicious smells tortured us daily during practice. \n\nNow, Bagels is my measuring stick for all others. None have measured up to a warm Bagels' bagel right out of the oven.",2
"I like this course a lot. Frankly speaking, this is my first completed course on Coursera. The instructor is so good that I could easily follow everything in the class. Give lots of credits to the assignments. Theyre very easy to follow for me. I really enjoy working on them. Thanks a lot!!!",2
I probs say this every Tuesday but Paper Towns is the best film I've actually seen and it just makes me love life,2
"Great protective case
Great protective case, the only thing is the side buttons are a little hard to push. But overall great product !",2
am proud of Facebook,2
"I have to start this review by letting everyone know how excited I am that a Moe's opened in Las Vegas! I'm from the east coast where they have quite a few Moe's! I used to eat there faithfully. So when I found out about this particular opening, I was thrilled. \n\nI have been ordering a to go lunch every single Saturday since it has opened! And have not once been disappointed by the food. I love the many options that you can pick from, nachos, bowls, burritos, salads, quesadillas, tacos and even something called a stack! I always end up ordering the vegetable band camp burrito bowl. I like the funky names for each option. \n\nIn my amazing band camp bowl, I always get extra rice, lots of grilled green peppers and onions, corn, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pickled and fresh jalape\u00f1os (A+ for having both!) and the famous queso dip on the side! I tried a sample of the black and pinto beans! I think next time I order a veggie bowl, I will add pinto beans for something different! \n\nI love that Moe's is so vegetarian and vegan friendly!!! Both pinto and black beans are vegetarian, they offer tofu for a little extra cost, and they use vegetarian cheeses and sour cream! The guacamole DOES NOT cost extra! :) They give you a free bag of chips too with your to go order and a variety of salsas are set out for you to take! \n\nMy experience this particular Saturday 11/01/14 was the best so far! The new girl starting the line was friendly and listened to what I wanted. The guy on the grille was explaining to me how they make a stacks order and kept all of the bins of veggie and meat options full. He was talkative and kind. The girl finishing the line was also friendly and I have seen her every Saturday along with the two boys at the end doing chips and cash register. I left with a smile on my face and I couldn't wait to get home and open my Moe's bag of goodness! \n\nI had one unpleasant experience and one a step above that, but the food at Moe's makes me want to return! In the hopes that the gentleman with the huge bouncy hair isn't working the grille on Saturday. BOTH times he was there they were out of peppers and/or onions. I'm a patient person so it doesn't bother me that bad. What bothers me was coming in the line, letting the girl know I want extra peppers and onions when they are completely empty of peppers, her letting the guy on the grille know, and him still not making it 10 minutes later. He was just goofing off and yelling at the girls to be quite and he's making it \""blah blah\"". I just stood there, waiting. Finally after about 15 minutes they had peppers to put on my bowl! Woohoo! Like I said....the food is yum.\n\nAll in all, I love you Moe's. I will see you every Saturday for our lunch date! :) And I will need to try this \""Stacks\"" thing soon!",2
i feeling very playful at that time decided to try something,2

"RETURNED - Not Needed
Looked fine. Not for good wear - costume clothing. Returned because we went a different direction with costume choice and didn't need it any longer.",2
"SOOO GOOD!! Delicious, hand-crafted, cooked to order & perfection! \n\nThis place is quite amazing. They have every kind of topping and combination of salad you could think of - as well as creating your own if you don't see something you like on their board. \n\nA little on the spendy side if you're looking for a regular salad, but these are more gourmet salads - not a subway salad.\n\nThe service is very quick and friendly, you walk in and head to the counter - watch them put everything together - cook, chop & toss it all the way you want! \n\n*Best tip about this place - the size of one salad can really feed 2 people - or take home the other half for another meal : )",2
Prompt service; excellent quality.,2
"Good nyonya food, clean, spacious and very friendly. Love the curry and nasi ulam.",2
"The staff and management at this hotel made our first trip to New York an unbelievable experience. When I told them I was coming with my daughter for a week in July 2012because coming to NYC was a lifelong dream of hers they surprised her with a message, WELCOME TO NYC, written on the bed with candy along with Welcome balloons in our hotel room when we arrived! We arrived early way before check in but that was not a problem, our room was ready and we were allowed to check in. The queen bed was very comfy and a choice of hard and soft pillows was available. We were greeted warmly every time we entered the lobby, and every morning at breakfast the staff was cheerful and hard at work. The hotel is in the perfect location from Time Square, all tourist attractions, shopping, restaurants, and especially the subway. The rooms are excellent, very nice and clean! Our room on the 34th floor was definitely worth the extra charge. The view was amazing!! We heard of people complaining about long waits for the elevator but we never had to wait longer than a few minutes for the elevator at any time of the day. The free breakfast is a perfect way to start your day; I loved the pancakes, the egg omelettes and cinnamon buns! It was more than we expected! A nice touch is the cold lemonade that is available in the lobby after being out in the heat all day. Anytime we ran into hotel staff, at breakfast, on the elevator, in the lobby, they were cheerful, helpful and pleasant. Jamie and Alex were amazing & could not have been more helpful. Thanks, guys!! Jamie went out of his way to help on numerous occasions. We had an evening flight home so our luggage was happily stored until we had to leave. Upon departure the front desk had arranged our ride for us and we were happily surprised to find out that a limousine had been sent. So, we went to the airport in style!! What a way to remember NYC!! Our stay at this hotel was such a positive experience and it definitely helped make our dream of a lifetime incredible!!! We will definitely stay here again when we return to NYC!! Thank you HOLIDAY INN TIMES SQUARE!!!",2
"I read all of the reviews and called the Radisson with any other questions that weren't answered here. I would say the use of the word ""resort"" is a bit loose. The Radisson is definitely not what I would call a resort. And for what they charge they should include a mini fridge and microwave in the suites. They will, however, provide you with either for $10 per night per item. I just think that's cheesy. But I knew before I booked the trip that this was the case. I have 2 little ones so a fridge full of fruit, juice, milk..it's a must. We just happen to have a cooler that can be plugged in and used just like a fridge. Perfect! The pools are great for kids and not so great if you're a single adult or couple with no kids. They are only 4ft deep at their deepest so it's perfect for kids. The kiddie pool didn't look yellow to me but the bottom surface is sandy colored which probably led to the previous reviewer saying it was yellow. We stayed in a Jr. Suite but really only for sleeping. We spent the majority of the two days in Sea World. Loved the free shuttle service. We went to Sea World on a Thurs. & Fri. and those were the perfect days to go. As we were leaving Saturday am, the shuttle service line was packed and I'm sure folks were getting hot & irritated by the wait. With the package we booked through the Sea World website, we received free breakfasts every morning. We also ate there for dinner and had the ribeye specials. The pecan pie is delicious. In fact, we were happy with everything we were served. Oh, they do charge $3 for the S'mores kit which you can avoid by simply bringing your own and a stick to roast the marshmellows with. The Radisson is very kid oriented...which is the main thing I care about when I'm traveling with my kids. They have a wonderful staff that does free face painting, necklace beading & various other crafts. They also do manicures & hair-do's for little girls that they charge a small sum for. In fact, all of the interactions I had with different staff members were pleasant, friendly & helpful.
My advice....read all the reviews, have realistic expectations and enjoy! It's not as bad as the horrible reviews it's received but it's not the Ritz either. (nor is it a resort) This is a great place to stay if you're taking the kids to Sea World.....period! I would not stay here if it were my honeymoon or if my husband & I were going on a trip without the kids.",2
"Great buy!!
These arrived super fast, excellent packaging and communication with the seller. Used these overnight and they certainly helped stretch the height of the show. They were rubbing a blister into the top of my feet and too expensive to throw out. We had high hopes for this product and they delivered! Hoping with more time stretching they will loosen even more. Very pleased with every aspect of this transaction!",2
"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on a brief visit to Chicago last week. We chose this hotel for its location, price and for having free car parking. Location is perfect to allow you to stroll around this wonderful city at leisure, all major attractions (Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Michigan Ave, Soldier Field etc) are all easily within walking distance. There is a multitude of excellent bars and restaurants all on the doorstep (try Fado Irish pub behind the hotel and many others on nearby Rush street)
The room we had was large clean and very comfortable, on the top floor looking over the massive 24 hour McDonalds across the road, no issues with noise at all.
There is a pool and small gym if you have the time to use them! Also a nice sitting area on the roof to catch some sun or relax after a long walk as we did.
Free tea & coffee are available in the lobby each morning (with cereal bars) and the front desk staff are very helpful in making sure you make the best of your time there, they offer discount attraction & tour tickets.
If we are ever back in Chicago (and I hope we are!) I would stay here again - highly recommended.",2
"Five Stars
Perfect for my little Shih Tzu. She likes to stretch out.",2
"Yummy! We ordered the family dinner to go - 16 (small) tortillas, salsa and carne asada for $20 plus we added a side of beans. everything was delicious! Cute place, very clean! Simple decor, nice patio (I will sit there next time!) Service was quick! I really enjoyed it! :)",2
"This is an older hotel, so if a little worn look bothers you or if you're fussy about things that don't really matter, skip it. However if you'd rather use your money for good meals or other SF delights and want a basic, clean, quiet (street noise doesn't count-you are downtown!), room with a good bed, good bathroom and excellent staff, then this is a great place for you. The location is fantastic, close to SF great mass transit, a short walk to the BART for easy transportation to the airport, etc. Keep in mind the great price and you will have a great stay.",2
"Sept.2017 . I have been here many Times over the Years and it is still excellent . Very friendly Staff , great Ambiance and the Steaks are very good . This time i ate a Tenderloin Steak sizzling , it was fantastic . If you are in KL , then you should visite this Restaurant . Highly recommended .",2

"We used to go here all the time and hadn't been in a while and decided to go to use the local's discount. I was real simple and got a pasta pomodoro and a tomato mozzarella salad. Both were great, the sauce was light and the pasta was home made. My Fiance got a seafood pasta and loved it. I think this place is overpriced, but if you can go with a local discount or late night deal or whatever it is def worth checking out.",2
"Must see.....great trip down memory lane of the great music of the 70's and 80's love that ROCK N ROLL! Enjoyed the show, great entertainers! Great value and lots of fun! Best show I've seen in a long time......we will go again",2

"I had the opportunity to stay at the JW Marriott San Francisco on August 25th. The hotel was beautiful, comfortable, and very conveniently located. I purchased a PURE room for the first time to see what it was all about. I typically suffer from allergies and hotel stays are typically challenging for me. This room made all the difference in the world and I was quite skeptical at first. They are basically hypo-allergenic rooms that have a PURE air filtering system that apparently can work wonders. I slept through the entire night and woke up feeling clear, rested, and very refreshed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It has a very understated luxury about it but was welcoming at the same time - nothing stuffy, just a very high level of service and quality.",2

"Going into seeing this movie I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy.Little did I know that I was in for a ride through cinematic magic. Everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection.Claire Danes shines like the star she is in this movie. From beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character.Michelle Pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.Robert De Niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.Overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, Stardust is the way to go.",2
"Wow! The service was great, the food was excellent, and the accommodations were top notch. I highly recommend this airline. The only thing I had a problem with is becoming a rewards member. You have to call internationally to talk to someone and I applied online, but can't get a Kris #.",2
Came here for their refreshing Sour Plum and lime drink. Also had a cup of beer and a bottle of Sommersby. Total RM 43. I found this rather expensive if not for the central location and needed a respite from the scorching sun.,2

"Cassa Hotel & Residences is a beautiful and have a really good location, 5 mins to Time squre and 15 min for the Empire State Building and close to Pen Station
The rooms are lovely furnished with good beds and nice large bathroom with large shower
Breakfast is paid for, and it was the only drawback to the hotel, you pay a relatively high price for almost nothing .. go either into one of the local Sanwich bar and buy breakfast there, there is a wide range
The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful ..
Will be back :-)",2
"Easy to find items required on website, arder process straightforward.",2
"Bed was very comfortable - great soft pillows too.
I booked online 1 day before arrival (2 nites stay) for a King bed at a special rate of $79.20 a night and requested a high floor near the elevator. And even though I didn't check in until 11 pm, I still got the top floor near the elevator! Room 808 overlooking parking lot (which I prefer so I can see my car).
Be aware that soap and one small shampoo is all you get (no hair conditioner). Important as my daughter and I have long hair and used the whole bottle each night. Thank goodness I happened to bring my own hair conditioner.
Another thing, when we checked in we had 3 plush, white, extra long bath towels in our clean bathroom but after maid service the next day, we ended up with 3 bath towels that barely made it around my body and they were thin and rough, not white and plush like the day before at all!! Dingy and gray.
Breakfast is 6 to 9am and it gets packed towards the 8 am hour. ( I was there near a holiday so that probably was a huge factor. July 5 and 6 mornings. A large selection too! Coffe, juices, toasts, fruit, yogurt, fruit loops and rice krispies, boiled eggs, eggs scrambled and make your own waffles, pigs in a blanket. The next day it was biscuits and fried potatoes instead of pigs in a blanket. There was instant oatmeal and milk available both days.
Overall the area felt very safe, even though I passed a nightclub about a mile or so away behind and south of the hotel.
There's a large mexican restaurant next door and fast access to the highway. I didn't go to restaurant next door as I got in late each night after visiting sea world. But the hotel did have some snacks for purchase which was great! They had a Healthy Choice frozen turke breast meal that I purchased to take to my room ( and a single bottle serving of wine) and I got to use the microwave in my room ! Fridge in room was small and roomy!
Overall I was very pleased!",2
"very fani,good content..",2
i managed to feel slightly sociable into the bargain something that has been absent on recent walks,2
"There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself.",2
"I opted to stay here because it was about half the price of the ""Inner Harbour"" hotels that are just a few blocks further south. I'm glad I did, as the hotel was great especially at the price. The rooms were on the whole excellent. They were nice and spacious, with a good bed, sofa, large desk to work on, big TV and a kitchen. The kitchen was pretty well stocked with implements, and you only had to ring downstairs for more. On the whole, the room felt like it belonged in a much much pricer place, which was great!
Only two downsides were the breakfast and the shower. I think if the rest of the hotel had been in line with what I'd paid I might not have noticed these two as much, but given how good the rest was they really stood out. There are plenty of nice places nearby for a better breakfast though, so no big deal!
Also, because this hotel is a few blocks north of the inner harbour, it's also only a few blocks away from the excellent (and free!) Walters Art Museum, so you can easily nip in there (which I'd very much recommend doing)",2
"Could not possibly say enough wonderful things about this hotel! We stayed in the suite - and were so impressed my husband took VIDEO of the place! **THREE** closets in this suite - one of them a walk in! Seriously, splurge for the suite if you can...",2
i do enjoy feeling smug about that once in a while,2
Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!,2
"I have flown this route many times on various airlines but Singapore Airlines is my preferred due to my SQ FF status. I get to use the lounge and have better access to preferred seating. This was my first flight on SQ288 departing Sydney daily at 9:30pm with a brief stop in Canberra. The full flight routing is Singapore-Sydney-Canberra-Singapore. May travellers get off in Canberra after a stop in Sydney. The route is serviced by a B777-300ER with First Class if you want. Loads out of Canberra are generally lighter. On this over night flight arriving one hour early at 4:00am I had 3 seats to myself and was able sleep for a while. However, the woman in front of me kept reaching back and touching the touch screen which turned it on and woke me up! What reach back all the time?? I had to keep turning if off in the dark cabin. We are at a hight alert level with the Corona Virus and all fight crew wore masks. They did not have to smile I guess but they said it with their eyes.",2
"A charming smaller hotel, just a 5 minute walk from the Convention Center. My room was smallish and could use a decor update, but very clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. Look for coffee and tea in the morning down in the lobby, iced tea late in the afternoon.Small fridge and safe in the room. Plenty of eating options on Boylston, and a food court in the Prudential center if on a budget. Very close to the Copley T station.",2
Every song every artist every time,2
"a hotel that does what it says on the tin. yes, it is by the Manhattan Bridge subway, you will need earplugs, but that aside you can't ask for anything more for the price i paid.
ensuite room, on Manhattan Island, spotlessly clean comfortable beds, tv, hot shower. also close to the F train subway, one of the best diners (Everest Diner is only 3 blocks to the left) in the area and a remarkably safe area after dark.
yes the subway goes by every 5-7 minutes and yes the place is next to a chinese market (and smells accordingly) but it is New York. real New York. i felt at home after the first 5 minutes.
only gripe is the staff weren't that friendly. and i got shaken down for storing my bag for the day after i checked out of my room which was a little surprising (only $2 but still).
i would stay here again, without question.",2
"5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.\n\nService was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well.",2
Went in for food twice over the weekend. First time i've been in since it had its 50's Diner Overhaul.\n\nAnyway the food is great not a huge selection but well worth the money. They also do the best breakfast i think i've ever had. Superb fry up for only \u00a36.50 nom nom nom. :),2
"Stayed here one night for an early flight out of the airport. It is 7 miles from CLT. I checked in late and left very early the next morning but the front desk and morning staff setting up the breakfast were very personable and helpful. This is a clean, quiet place to stay near plenty of amenities.",2

Went here one day for breakfast & their signature cocktail (scorpion ). \n\nEverything was tasty from the drink to the pancakes to the eggs (which they poached for us - some places refuse to do this...?!?) to the sausage. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend going here. It's a must go to spot for me whenever I go to Vegas!,2
"Have eaten there twice since it opened. Since my husband is 100% Italian, we have difficulty finding restaurants that come up to his standards.\nThis small,quaint, lovely restaurant does just that. The first time I had the penne with the veal bolognese, and meatballs that literally would melt in my mouth. My hubby had the pasta with rapini, of which he is a fan, and said it was cooked perfectly, and it is difficult to cook rapini well. The next visit was the lobster fettuccini with a light tomato sauce. The lobster was fresh (not a hint of a fishy smell or taste), cooked perfectly, and totally flavorable. We also had the clams with linguine. Not a hint of sand, and the clams were totally tender. Each time the pasta was done PERFECTLY al dente which is so rare to find. I seldom eat an entire pasta dish, but it was so delicious that I pushed it down. The owner not only makes his own fresh mozzarella daily, but also his own sausage. You can even buy it at the small deli counter when you enter, so you could try to make some Italian dishes at home. We plan to be regulars. The food is outstanding and we have recommended to many, many people. We hope they do well. They have a varied menu, with mozzarella boards, paninis, pizzas, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. The restaurant is small, intimate and well worth the trip. We feel lucky it is in our neighborhood and I get a break from making sauce.",2
"The best sushi I have ever had! The service was excellent. I can't believe we found this place in a strip mall in the middle of the desert!! We will definitely return, with friends!",2
"The only negative during my four-night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn on W. 35th was that the internet connection was horrendously slow for part of the time. A slow net connection is beyond horrible when you're in an exciting city like New York and don't want to waste time waiting while a picture that would normally upload in less than a minute takes an hour. Otherwise, I loved the hotel. The location is quite convenient, with a subway station just outside the door, restaurants nearby, a great deli around the corner. The refrigerator in the room was also convenient. All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I will give the net slowness the benefit of the doubt and deem it an unusual glitch and will thus stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again. (If I have internet problems on a second stay, I'll cross it off of my list and will submit an updated review here.)",2
"I'm a pretty big barns and noble fan over all and in general. I like this place for a couple of reasons. First they are open late at this location, even on Sundays. Once I was walking around with some friends around 10pm and we were trying to think of what to do and noticed Barnes & Noble was still open which I thought was AMAZING!!!\n\nI've purchased dozens of books from here and I've never had an issue with a book I couldn't find.\n\nThe staff is usually hard to seek out but only because they always seem to be helping people find books. For the most part there set up is pretty easy but every once in a while there is that book I want but can't seem to find anywhere and even the workers wonder what happened to it.\n\nEvery once in awhile they have sales which is great because the books can get expensive. And I love that they have a Starbucks built inside so you can buy your book, buy a latte, and sit down and read in peace.\n\nIt's also pretty quiet which is another plus for me.",2
"I spent 3 days in April of 2006 at the Flatotel NY. There were 4 adults and 2 young children in a 2 bedroom suite.
As promised (via many phone calls to confirm) I booked, and received a ""renovated"" 2 bedroom suite in the Flatotel. As I understand, about half of the hotel's suites are renovated, and the other half are what I assume to be the original suites which, if you read all the reviews on this site, are allegedly terrible! Whew!
Check in went very smoothly, although they expect FULL payment upon checking in. This was something that I found extremely odd and was a bit apprehensive about, but paid anyway.
The initial impression of our suite was not very dramatic. HOWEVER, upon further exploration, it is a great unit. You have to remind yourself that you are in Manhattan. If you want a luxurious, large, flawless suite with a full kitchen--be prepared to pay thousands per night elsewhere. Our suite was a corner unit, facing southwest. The views were great, especially for the kids. The windows were extremely large and run along each wall.
The coolest thing about this hotel, was that it was CLEARLY a condominium building that was converted to a hotel/suite hotel. Our suite still had a doorbell! (fun for our toddler). The suite had 1 and a half baths, which was fantastic. The bathrooms are in terrific condition and were very clean. The living room was a bit small, and the furniture was a bit uncomfortable. There was, however, a large flat screen TV on the wall as promised. The beds were great and clean, although it is true that they are modern platform beds which have a base that is bigger than the mattress, so lookout to save your ankles! One of the bedrooms had all glass walls, but, could be completely covered with heavy dark drapes to make the room very private. The kitchen was fully stocked, even with cooking utensils, and came in extremely handy! We ate dinner in our suite each night. I recommend using the Ernst Klein market about 1 block north on 6th ave for food.
The rumors about the elevators are true. Sometimes you need to wait a bit for an elevator, but, as someone who lived in a highrise for years, if you pretend you're simply waiting for your elevator in an apartment building it's not bad at all.
The hotel is in a FABULOUS location. Very close to Times Square, ten minute walk to Toys R Us and Build A Bear. 5-10 min walk to Central Park and enormous playground. The location and price for a suite was what drew me to the hotel.
It's a Manhattan hotel that serves it's purpose with cost for a full suite, service, and location. Don't stay here if you expect or want your hotel to be a central focal point of your vacation (ex: Loews, Hilton Times Square). It provides a peaceful retreat from the city (as if you are returning to your own condo in NY) at the end of the day, and the staff is efficient and curteous but stays out of your way.
I will end this lengthy (but I hope helpful review) by saying that the concierge, Gregory, is absolutely wonderful! He made our stay so terrific. Anything you need to know, want, etc, Gregory knows the answer, or knows where to get it.
Overall--a good experience.",2

"Wir verbachten insgesamt fünf Nächte im Hotel, und es war super angenehm.
Lage:
Mitten in Korea-Town, Entfernung zur U-Bahn, Wallgreens und Dauane Reade (Drogerie und 24h-alles-was-man-braucht-Laden) innerhalb von 250m, Restaurants in großer Zahl direkt um das Hotel herum. Kurze Transfers von allen Airports, da direkt in der Nähe des ""Tunnels"".
Personal:
Super freundlich, auch unser late-night-chek-in (ca. 23:45 Ortszeit) war problemlos und sehr höflich, auch der Kofferträger war noch im Dienst. Lokaltipps und Hilfestellungen werden gerne gegeben.
Zimmer:
Das Zimmer war sehr groß - auch im Vergleich zu anderen Zimmern in denen ich gewohnt habe - in New York in der selben Kategorie. Das Design mag eher konservativ sein, aber alles notwendige ist da: Großer Schrank, Schreibtisch, LCD-Fernseher, Schreibtisch, Kaffeemaschine, Mikrowelle (!!), gratis Internet, großes Bad, Bügeleisen/-brett, ...
In der Lobby gibt es gratis Kaffee und zwei Internet-Terminals.
Frühstück:
Das kostenlose Frühstück umfasste den amerikanischen Standard: Pappteller/-Becher, Kaffee, Tee, Obst, Eier, div. Brötchen, Bagels (In verschiedenen Sorten), Saft, ...
Der Frühstücksraum war nicht sehr elegant, aber alles in allem sehr in Ordnung.
Andere Services:
Wurden nicht in anspruch genommen - ein Buchungs-Service für diverse Dinge (Tickets, Transfers, etc.) steht in der Lobby zur Verfügung, ist aber deutlich teurer als eine Dirketbuchung.",2

"Stopped in for lunch today.. great service & food, even my meat & potatoes hubby was thrilled.\n\nWe had the sauteed edamame, very good, but the fire from the chilis was starting to get overwhelming when the food arrived - great timing.\n\nI had the special, a Loch Duarte Salmon sandwich and Just Fries. First, the fries.. sheer perfection, and the pineapple ketchup was surprisingly delicious and perfect for such a hot day. The salmon sandwich was nicely balanced, with the bacon being beautifully caramelized and giving a nice smoky crunch that kept the salmon from being overpowering. I was expecting good, I got great instead. \n\nI was stuffed when I left, and I had half a sandwich and over half the fries left.. made me want to cry to leave it behind, but couldn't squeeze in another bite and didn't want to deal with leftovers.\n\nHubby ordered the Ronin Burger and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries. First his fries.. he couldn't leave them alone. As for the burger, he had ordered it medium and it arrived well done, but that didn't stop him from eating every single bite and practically moaning with ecstasy with each bite. He didn't even care that there was no ketchup or mustard on his burger, he just knew he was in heaven.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.. and soon :D",2
"This hotel is consistent worth other Springhill Suites. My room was clean, quiet, smelled good, and comfortable.
The internet was free and lightning fast. There was a free hot breakfast which was nice because of the California navel oranges. The TV had a great channel selection! Hook ups for RCA and monster jacks. Microwave and mini fridge as well as free tooth paste and brush at the front desk.
If I didn't have a double the HVAC would have been loud. The desk has no view of the TV to work and watch. There are cookies at check in that were gone by 6pm check in :-(
It seemed like it was far from food. With a quick search it is super close to McDonalds, Wendy, and Bojangles. One exit down is a great cheap Mexican spot named Miguel's. It is right next door to a strip club but felt safe because of the private lot.
The feather pillow sealed the deal. I'd come back for a short work trip.",2

"My friend and I stayed at this property over the weekend (Aug 19-21) after booking through priceline.com for under $100/night. While we had our reservation on how good the hotel would be for <$100 in the heart of downtown, we took our chances. Upon arrival and check-in, we were THRILLED with the location, upscale decor, amenities and spotless room! The front desk staff was great as he was more than happy to check our bags until our room was ready so we could go out into the city for the afternoon.
The room itself was cozy and small but more than adequate in size for two people. The two twin beds were luxuriously comfortable with superior mattresses; quality, high-thread count sheet and beautiful, heavy comforters, topped of with thick pillows. The cherry wood desk and work area were top quality while the room even featured a standard microwave and mini-fridge. The bathroom was spotless, featuring wonderful soaps, complimentary mouthwash, glass cocktail glasses and a coffee/tea maker.
Other amenities that went above-and-beyond our expectations were a shopping service to stock the mini-fridge at REGULAR consumer prices (vs. inflated room service prices), delivery of treadmills or exercise bikes TO YOUR ROOM for working out in private, free WiFi service throughout the property and free PC's and printers to use in the club room on the main level.
We'd stay at Club Quarters for future trips to Chicago without question! The downtown location is suberb- 1 block from the Blue Line Jackson stop and 2 blocks from the State Street Red Line stops. You're 6 blocks from the Art Institute and in the heart of the city! OUTSTANDING!",2

"Easy in and out access in downtown Dallas. Valet's on hand to take our car and luggage, quick check in. We had a problem with the door lock and one phone call and 10 minutes later we were in a lovely room on the same floor. Complimentary evening drinks, milk and cookies made my husband very happy. I liked the roomy bathroom. We had a great view of 4th of July fireworks from 18th floor.",2
29th July 2013. London Heathrow to Cologne flight 4U461. I checked in online for the flight as instructed on their website and then went to the airport ‘bag drop. The queue was very long and only one lady was in charge of the entire queue. She understandably looked stressed. Flight was on an A319 and the seats were comfortable enough for a short trip. A snack was offered for sale as this airline is a Budget airline but one which allows for through baggage. I picked this airline for my trip down to Italy partly based on price and partly based on the reputation of being the best of the lower price airlines. The captain was informative and the crew seemed to be pleasant and very well turned out indeed. During quite bad turbulence not enough was done to calm the fears of passengers. Arrival into Cologne was a pleasure and the modern and friendly airport made for a good stop over on my way to Italy. I shall report my next flight in more detail in a separate report.,2
"ヒルトンニューヨーク、Run Of Houseで予約して4泊した感想です。【良かった点】・綺麗で清潔・ベッドが心地よい・照明の数が多い・収納がたっぷり・USA TODAYのサービスがある・コーヒーメーカーがある・デスク&チェアが綺麗で使いやすい・超大型ホテルなのにレセプションは混んでいない(並んでも2,3人)【悪かった点】・ハウスキーピングが完璧でない(いつも何か忘れられる・超大型ホテルのためエレベーターがほぼ各階に停まる・エレベーターが古いのかよく揺れる・週末は若者が多く騒がしい・ニューヨークの割りに周辺は夜暗い・メトロの駅から意外と遠い・日本人宿泊客が多い・シャワーが固定式・お湯が時々ぬるくなる・空調が思うように効いてくれない と悪かった点もありますが、いつも名もなきホテルを利用している私にとってはヒルトンニューヨーク最高でした!アメリカなんて見るとこないじゃん、なんて侮っていましたが、このホテルのおかげもあり、初ニューヨークでかなりはまりました。",2

"LOVE this hotel. It's so new, grand, and just fabulous. The only thing I don't like is that it's pretty far at the end of the strip. Walking to the middle is kind of a long trek. The pool is awesome too, great music, and the service is excellent. \n\nI have nothing bad to say about this hotel.",2

"I 100% love this app, but the only thing is that do you know on iPhone how you swipe left on the message that you have sent and you can see if the message has been read by someone. I would like that feature on android too because it really is convenient for me to simply swipe left and see rather than hold on it, then click info which kinda feels inconvenient especially when you're using it in one hand. I would appreciate it if you guys can add this feature to android. Thank you.",2

"This Sheraton, though a little dated, still holds up to the Sheraton name,
This one in Mission Valley is right off the freeway. We stayed on the side closest to the freeway, but it wasn't too noisy to sleep.
The room was big, nice and the bathroom was updated and large.
The front desk staff was very accomodating.
Pool and hot tub are also nice. The breakfast we had in their restaurant could have been better.
Overall, a decent hotel. Don't expect anything special, but you won't be disappointed.",2
"First of all about 10 minutes after you talk to Jeff ya gonna wanaa give'em a hug. He's like a big'O teddy bear and a sweetie-pie ta boot! Even his crew that worked on my bathroom were just a bunch of sweethearts. Just really nice people with good, positive energy. Like they're happy or something.\n\nWe had a slab leak and needed the shower replaced. We asked Jeff if he could do both, and he said \""Yep! Sure can.\"" I don't know anything about plumbing or showers or anything building archtectuallaleee! All I wanted was the leak stopped and that disgusting shower replaced. So when we talked to Jeff about it, he (interior designer that he is) made suggestions on putting in a shower that was sexy. I listened and looked up pics on the internet and, \""DING\"", who knew a shower (MY SHOWER) could have such appeal\n\nLong story short - we now have a cool and sexy shower that looks like it belongs in a spa (I'm now chargin for showers in my bathroom) and no more slab leak.\n\nJeff and crew were a pleasure boat filled with expertise and professionalism.",2

"While I agree this was a 1950s sitcom, I don't feel it was ""typical"". Firstly, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike the regular 50s sitcom moms. She made a stand for women's worth and equality (remember the episode where the TV announcer says ""just a housewife"") and Donna stands up for all women do and represent, especially those that don't work outside the home? And when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was not something trivial...it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the show's producer, so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful character.The children were intelligent, but not precocious. They were normal kids. And they could ACT.Something else that made Donna Reed Show stand out was not only did the children LOOK like their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation, which then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors, and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn't seen on the other family shows. And the characters could be flawed, and in major ways, and yet, accepted for the flaws and mistakes. These were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows. They were normal people acting as normal people.Women's rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but can't afford it...it was all shown on this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era.Donna Reed show didn't last for eight years without a reason. And it could have possibly endured, had it not been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed divorcing.This show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality.In summary, I agree with the original poster, who obviously cares for the show, but I think that the Donna Reed show has SO much more to offer than casual entertainment.",2

"250th Review!!! WOOT WOOT! \n\nEvery year my office has a Team Appreciation Event, a party for us! Been with the company 12 years and we have done a lot, but this time we went the idea of having an Hawaiian Luau, for family and coworkers. Being on the events committee at work, we knew what we wanted just didn't know where to go and didn't want cheesy tiki torches lit in someone's back yard, we did some research and found Tia's Royal Islander out in the east valley. \n\nWhat a great find! Tia's Royal Islander is a perfect place for you Hawaiian luau, they have the perfect location, they have the performers, and they have the food! It's a party just waiting for people to show up! And they are local & family owned!\n\nSo we found the place, set the date and then waited for the fun to begin! \n\nFor the buffet, we had Kalua Pork (omg delish!!!) Teriyaki Chicken (everyone was raving about the chicken) Island Rice, BBQ Beans, Tropical Fruit Salad and some dinner rolls, some tropical punch, and hot chocolate (it was a cold Nov day for this event) and even mai tais! Everyone got their food and waited for the show to being.\n\nOh let me also say that while everyone is arriving to the event there is a live band & signer too, you quickly get into the island spirit! \n\nOh but the entertainment is what its all about! Hula dancers & fire dancer!!! Oh it was such a great show! \n\nIf you are looking for an Hawaiian or Island themed place for an event, this is your place!! Did I tell you it was family run? Ohana means family and at Tia's they will treat you like one of their own!\n\n\n**ps yea I know I went a little picture crazy, but this was a great place & great event!",2
AMS-TLL-SVO-TLL-AMS. Estonian Air still had a reasonable fare for this route. Nice modern CRJ900 planes on AMS-TLL and a bit tired and worn Boeing 737 from TLL to SVO and back.

Food and beverage service pretty basic just soft drinks and rye-bread sandwiches. No comments regarding the luggage since I was travelling just with a cabin bag.,2

"In the fall of 2010 we visited Macau and were introduced to Portuguese Egg Tarts. They were so wonderful we stood under a tree on the plaza outside the shop and ate 3 apiece. This week, after a wonderful lunch at the Noodle Palace, we went in search of a bakery for custard tarts. We decided to hunt in the Spring Mountain Mall and came across Diamond Bakery. As soon as we walked in, we saw the case with egg custards, and though they looked good, we didn't think they were the same as what we remembered. Then our eyes fell on the item right beside them: Portuguese Egg Tarts! We were so excited. We bought 6 (@$1.50 each) and took them home. We were delighted that even after a 30 minute drive home, they were still warm! They were wonderful. Delicious filling and a very flakey crust. Couldn't have asked for a better re-creation of the tarts we had in Chinese Macau.",2

The steak tartare was above standard although I have had better in Singapore, it is a worthwhile rendition for KL.

Our guide was efficient in explaining the way everything worked and showing us the pumps, tanks, etc. We were able to talk with the aquarists about the different sea life and feeding habits. Watched them feed the sharks as well. Very informative experience. Everyone was super nice. We even got three free pictures of ourselves feeding the turtles. As for the aquarium it's self it was very neat. It is small and kind of expensive so look for coupons.",2
"Wir waren Im April vier Tage im Sheraton. Es war einfach wunderbar. Wir hatten ein Zimmer der Kategorie ""Executive Club Level & Lounge"" gebucht. Der Ausblick war umwerfend. Unser Zimmer, die Nr.3416, im 34.Stock ( Club Level-Zimmer sind auf den Etagen 33 u.34), bot Ausblick auf gleich mehrere der wesentlichen Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt: Sears Tower zur Linken, direkt vor uns der Chicago River mit der Michigan Avenue Bridge, der Trump Tower, die Marina Towers, das Wrigley Building ( Teil) ,derT ribune Tower, und zur Rechten der Hancock Tower. Was will man mehr? Bei Zimmer 3416 ist der Lounge-Bereich direkt nebenan. Dort gab es morgens ein kostenloses Frühstücksbuffet, tagsüber immer Kaffee und Snacks und abends noch Hors D'Oevres, die das Abendessen ersetzten. Der Lounge-Bereich ist sehr großzügig über zwei Etagen angelegt, mit mehreren Sitzgelegenheiten: Couchen und Sessel (mit zwei großen Fernsehern) sowie Stühle und Tische..Außerdem standen zwei PCs zum kostenfreien Internetsurfen zur Verfügung. Das Zimmer war ausreichend groß, das Marmorbad in tadellosem Zustand. Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal. Leute, die gut zu Fuß sind, können alle wesentlichen Sehenswürdigkeiten in kurzer Zeit zu Fuß erreichen. ""Vor der Tür"" beginnt quasi die ""Magnificent Mile"", und zur anderen Seite erstreckt sich der ""Loop""-Bereich. Wir haben jedenfalls nicht einmal Bahn oder Bus benutzen müssen ( obwohl das Fahren mit der Hochbahn sicher auch ein Erlebnis ist). Der Lobby-Bereich ist sehr weitläufig, edel und angenehm ( im Gegensatz zum hochgelobten Eingangsbereichs des gegenüberliegenden Hyatt, der eher Bahnhofscharakter hat). Interessant: zwei Tische, deren komplette Platte ein einziger Monitor sind. Das Personal war hilfsbereit, das Zimmer wurde vernünftig gesäubert. Alles in allem ein tolles Haus, das ich jedem empfehlen kann. Nur Vorsicht bei der Benutzung des Zimmertelefons. Ich habe fünf kurze Gespräche mit meinem Sohn ( eine Nummer in Massachusetts) geführt und durfte dafür mehr als 100 Dollar bezahlen. Diese Erfahrung macht schlauer, kann aber den vorzüglichen Eindruck des Sheraton nicht trüben.",2

"My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less. The story is quiet simple. Matt Saunders(Luke Wilson) meets Jenny(Uma Thurman) on the subway and hooks up with her. In the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be OK, but then Matt finds out that she's G-Girl. At first that seems really cool to Matt but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague Hannah(Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend.What I liked most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl avenges herself on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role then her character from the Scary Movie saga.I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy.",2
i feel so honored to be nominated for this award,2
i bought a round it was also because i have not bought rounds for a very very long time and i feel it is part of being considerate to the host establishment the tournament operators and fellow competitors,2
"Truly the best of the Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas. The show was awe inspiring not only for the acrobatics, but for the dancers, light show and graphics on various screens. And of course, Michael Jackson's music. At one point, Michael Jackson shows up to dance with the rest of the performers via hologram.",2
"This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's ""Oliver Twist"". For the most part, the original story has been maintained, though for the flow of the film certain subplots (such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half-brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, Fagin is hanged--an ending very different from this musical film.This is a one of a kind musical--one whose style and scope really hasn't been matched before or since. Not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. Whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing, here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more. It's truly a sight to see and I was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories. Having just seen it again a few moments ago, I would have to say that the film only got better over time. Great sets, wonderful acting and singing--this is a special treat that is hard not to love.By the way, when I saw the film again tonight, I was surprised by just how high and feminine Mark Lester's singing was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice.",2
"Amazing staff. Even when I had tons of questions they answered them within a day of me sending them an email and are very polite and helpful. Great build quality, great price, fast service and easy website to use. Definitely would recommend and will be using them again when I need an upgrade. 10/10!",2
"The best buffet in town! We paid $34/person, kinda pricey... at least compared to all the other buffet in town, but it's definitely worth the money. And kids 12 and under pay half ($17), whereas other buffet places, such as Bellagio, you have to pay full price for kids.\n\nThe food selections are great... not too overwhelming like some other places where it has all kinds of dishes for all types of cuisines, but most of them you won't even bother to touch or try anyway. This place has enough selections of food you'd want to eat or try out. \n\nThe biggest draw here is their Alaskan king crab legs. They're huge and fresh and delicious! My dad had 2 full plates. I had my shares too. The lamb chops and prime ribs are grade AAA! The shrimp cocktails, smoked salmon (too bad they dont give you cream cheese) are super fresh... \n\nThe dessert... pleasing to the eye and tasty to the mouth!!! YUM!!! Loved their cheesecake, cream puff and chocolate cake (even though I'm not a chocolate fan). They have a wide selection of sorbet and ice cream as well, and it's not from some ice cream machines. You get to order it through the baker so it feels \""expensive!\"" :)\n\nThis is my second time here, better than I remembered it. And this is our 2nd (and last buffet) we had in Vegas for this trip. Will definitely come back again. If you'll only have 1 buffet for the entire trip, this is it!",2
"Had the lunch set the other day, with the squid ink risotto and cannoli for dessert. No words to describe, on point with everything. I knew it was good the moment I tasted the complimentary fluffy bread with truffle butter.",2
Nice food but the queue for waiting is quite long. But the wait is worth it.,2
"Wow! That was our first words when we arrived. The two bedroom suite that we stayed in for four nights was fantastic. It was well presented with lovely furniture and a fantastic kitchen. We had a seperate bathroom and an ensuite and all the amenities were great.
It was a great base to tour the city with the metro stop only minutes away and whilst many shops were shut over the weekend when the whole place kind of shuts down we never had problems finding food. The is a cafe wth great food in the same building and during the week there is coffee, yoghurt and pastries for free in the hotel cafe with three internet computers for guests to use. There was also biscuits and coffee available all day which was greatly appreciated.
We will be coming back to the AKA White House when we return to Washington, and can't recommend it highly enough. It was a great taste of what it would feel like to live in such an interesting place.",2
"Best authentic Japanese katsu in town, with unlimited refill of Japanese rice, salad n pork stock miso soup with every main course!!",2
Great place to take in the view :),2
I love it I didn't like shrimp before and now at boiling crab it changed. I love the shrimp the favor is so good I can have a bucket of it. The chicken wings are delicious! And the fries and rice is so good! I love the Boiling Crab,2
Great but too many useless ads,2
"Excellent service, food and staff. Reasonable on the pocket. The Escargots was excellent! Good sized portions. Recommend the dessert - Tiramisu with a twist! Shant share.. that would spoil the surprise. Head Chef provided the final touch by both recommending and serving it in person! A personal touch goes a long, long way... well done!",2
"This really is a very good hotel. The staff were all completely charming; the room was clean, large, recently decorated amd well appointed. The food in the two restaurants was good (better than good in the Oyster Bar). Breakfast was a little disappointing, however (better to walk 10 mins to the Trident cafe and book store). But I think the no 1 slot is a bit misleading - this is not a top hotel and although close to the subway, it is actually a significant hike into town from there making it less than convenient compared to competitors. Contrary to what others have written there was traffic noise, and noise from the corridor, though not from other rooms. Nor was it cheap.
NB Warning. Apparently the hotel is changing hands. This was a little evident in that supplies of certain branded items were short (slippers, notepaper) but no worse than that. It does not follow that the new owner will necessarily keep up the good work of the previous one, though, so old reviews should be treated cautiously.",2
"At the beginning of this film, which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didn't know if I wanted to continue watching...although it didn't really seem to me that I had much of a choice, so compelling was the situation.Gradually, though, that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely), and I felt drawn into Tessa & Bobby's predicaments, and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.Really just a moving, powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now I love it even more.I definitely recommend it. ...If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime, or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.",2
"Stayed here one night on our way to South Carolina and were pleasantly pleased. Rooms were HUGE, clean and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom could use a bit of updating but overall it was clean and towels were not the cheap ones I've noticed in hotels before. Complimentary breakfast was also good.",2

"Great for first college apartment!
Decent quality tools, and good selection of useful items. The hammer is a good weight and not flimsy like in other kits. The bag is very nice and has extra room. Put together dresser, desk, nightstand and other apt items no problem. Cons: needs a multi blade small hand saw had to buy one separately. Also doesn’t come with basic screws/nails for hanging pictures or any electrical or duct tape. Adjustable wrench would also be a plus. All in all a decent set for the price. Just know what you need when comparing - no one needs a 100 piece set where they count items you will never use.",2
"It's difficult reading what you might have missed on your TL. Very often, you see an interesting post and it goes off, you can't return to it again.

I usually always buy my gas here and the price is always reasonable. I've even had my car serviced here a few times and David always makes sure its right!! Also very nice car wash attached to the gas station that works very well!,2
"Awesome product
Product was 100% what I expected.",2
"I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple.It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for.Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.",2
"This is a really special restaurant in Montreal. I had a delicious, relaxing meal here. The staff was gracious and welcoming. And the food was wonderful. The restaurant's atmosphere is cozy and elegant, and it's off a little side street in Old Montreal. A bit more expensive than some options, though I really enjoyed it.",2
"Great Hotel Location, in quiter area of New York. Streets lined with Trees and well kept houses, looks just like the film set of many a movie/tv show, with many flamboyant friendly residents. When out on my own as a single female I always felt safe!! For eating the hotel is a few mins walk to either a Cafe or deli's for a quick sandwich to fantastic italian/Thai restaurants. Their are many bars to suit any mood from a quite drink to all night parties. The Hotel staff are so friendly and helpful, the rooms are not the most spacious but adaquate and bed very comfortable, for smokers their is a quite roof top seating area from where you can see the Empire State Building, i recomend sitting there of an eveing with a bottle of wine. As the hotel has no bar or restaurant you are able to keep drink/eating bills within budget to suit yourself and the hotel have no objections to takeaway deliveires either which is great. Hotel also free wifi and a computer room with printer for guests which is great to if you are coming in from abroad and a cheap way to keep intouch with friends and family and print off air tickets etc. Im going back to this hotel wouldnt stay anywhere else in new york, i loved it. sharon ward uk.",2
good service from the driver,2
I have been here twice for haircuts. Both times left me feeling confident and refreshed! Mandi is amazing and so is Kim (an instructor). Can't beat the price or the customer service!,2
really useful app perfect for collaborating with brands,2
"I preferred the third course that emphasized practical application in the specialization over the second course that was mostly theory. The assignments were geared to engage your insights / ideas about what you know and/or are learning about real-life projects. Although it still only scratches the surface, I liked the ability to apply some of the assignments to a company with which Ive been working.",2
"I took my wife to Orinea for her Birthday dinner. We selected the five course menu (RM188/person). My wife asked the foie gras Appetizer to be replaced with something else, for which an extra RM18 was charged. I was surprised that the restaurant would charge this, but did not comment as I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere.We enjoyed the Amuse-bouche and Starter as each had its own taste and presentation. I had Angus sirloin for Entrée, which was very tasty. My wife had the red snapper and found it rather tasteless, especially compared to the previous courses. We both found the Dessert (mango based) the least of the courses. It was too sugary sweet and did not match the refinement of the other courses.This restaurant presents itself as being in the ""haute cuisine"" category: meaning many courses but each course consists of a small amount. Nevertheless was the total amount sufficient for us: we did not leave hungry. The pace at which the courses were served was fine: not too fast or too slow.There were a few things which I liked less about the experience:(*) The interior decoration. The restaurant looks very sterile. The floor has dark tiles. All walls are black and are without decoration. The tables and chairs are black with metal legs. The lights remain dimmed at night except for a strong blue ceiling light, giving the impression that you are in a night club. This is not my preferred setting for a nice dinner.(*) I had made a reservation online and the reservation mentioned that I would ""get a RM20 voucher for After Hours x 2"". I expected this to be useful for having coffee after finishing dinner, as that was not included in the selected menu. However, upon entering the restaurant the waiter told me that this voucher would be given to me after I had paid and would only be valid on a next visit to the restaurant. In my eyes is this a blatant sign of misleading marketing as it is nowhere mentioned that the voucher could not be used on the same visit. After having left the restaurant I noticed that the waiter did not give me the vouchers.(*) In between courses were we regularly pushed by the waiter to write a positive review on social media (e.g. Facebook, Tripadvisor). This happened at least three times, even though we did not have mobile phones on the table. He even promised ""something special"" if we would show him our online message during the dinner. I don't know whether this is restaurant policy, or that only our waiter did this. I think that this is very inappropriate for a restaurant in this category. The waiter made very sure that we know and remember his name: he pointed multiple times at his badge saying his name is Akie.All in all is it clear to me that Orinea has a very good kitchen, but I have some hesitations towards the restaurant. In this category of the market, and at this price range, do I have higher expectations of a restaurant, its pricing policies and its staff.",2
"Surat Thani to Bangkok. This flight went smooth, on time, not very narrow seats either. A few years ago, those flight with Air Asia were always delayed, often with several hours, so we stoped using them, but now they have really improved. We have had 4 legs, the last two months no delays. The ground staff at Surat Thani should have taken 'how do you get satisfied customer' lessons. When we checked in we had bought 20 kg of luggage, one bag was 14 kgs, and we thought of sending another bag, but then the total weight became 21 kilos. Instead of taking out something from one of the bags, we brought it onboard, 'plenty of space' for luggage in the cabin, not in the belly of the aircraft. When we were boarding a very rude staff, organizing the queues, by the book, not what was the most efficient way.",2

"2nd time i've stayed here. first time writing a review. got a good deal on the hotel since summer is slow time for phoenix, i agree with all the other good reviews, take a look at them, but in general my go to place for good hotel room that isn't too expensive compared to the other places around.",2
"I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated, the camera keeps going. the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration-camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing. don't watch this movie if your already depressed. then again don't watch it if your feeling really good.",2

"Some friends and I made reservations for one night because we wanted to try our luck at the near by casino. We pulled up and the outside appearance was nice, the lobby and staff were pleasant. The rooms not so pleasant. While they were clean they were very outdated. They still had the old style spread that you take off the bed as soon as you arrive. As I was laying down I felt something poking me and to my suprise it was a hotel pen lodged under the fitted sheet. Breakfast was just as disappointing with the super hard tato-tarts and rubbery processed scrambled eggs.Let me not forget the broken elevator. Despite my lodging I had a great time because I went home a gran richer.",2
An amazing app a close friend of all musicans..ui can say proudly..my self as a MUSIC DIRECTOR and FLUTIST...of ANYTICKETS MUSICAL EVNTS LONDON.,2
Went to ohjahs tonight. It was our first time there. Outside it smells AMAZING so you instantly float your way in. The lighting was perfect which set the mood. My girlfriend and I spilt some sushi which was splendid! Very fresh. If your in the area def stop at this spot to try it out.,2
"Our family came down to San Antonio for a Lackland AFB graduation ceremony and we chose Hotel Indigo due to the TripAdvisor ratings. This turned out to be an excellent choice for us and I would say that it would be an excellent choice for anyone else.
The staff was very helpful, especially Benjomin & Michael. We required an early breakfast each day of our stay and this was taken care of with a professional attitude by the hotel staff. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The decor was refreshing. The in house bar & bistro was top notch. The location (adjacent to the Alamo) was perfect, as it is a short trip on foot to the River Walk (10mins). Please use this recomendation in making your lodging choice in San Antonio. Good service and bargain room prices deserve to be rewarded!",2
"Just so easy, we'll satisfied from start to finish",2
"I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.",2
"What's the point of opening a hotel with say, 500 rooms, and not providing a garage to park in? A parking fee of 14 dollars per night is way too much. The rooms are small, smell like shoe freshener and the bathrooms are small with a tiny sink. You're better off staying at a less classier place for half the price. The location blows; right by the highway and there's nothing but a huge green mountain right behind the hotel. This place is more like 2 stars as I work for a 4 star 5 diamond joint in Vegas and I find it hard to believe that the Sheraton is only 1 star less. Give me a break.",2
The Staffs are really helpful and friendly. Good place and food. Highly recommended for families and tourists.,2

Here is something cool to check out in Vegas...and it is free.\n\nWe were sightseeing in Vegas. Most of the hotels have their own theme so they are all neat to check out. We went by the Bellagio. Outside the Bellagio the fountains light up and dance. We kept missing it and finally were able to catch it. It is an absolutely beautiful sight to see.,2

"I had booked a 10:30 p.m. shuttle from the airport only to find out they sent the driver home early. He had been there since 8 a.m. and the manager didn't think there was anything wrong with sending him home early and not replacing him. I guess they don't take these bookings seriously. They reimbursed our taxi fare, but after an 8 hour flight from London, I was tired and rather annoyed at the lack of efficiency. It's not like they were happy to reimburse us either. Apparently, we shouldn't have paid the taxi driver directly. He was supposed to come into the hotel to collect payment.
Overall, the hotel is nicely decorated and I was pleased with the room, a large one bedroom suite. Plenty of space. I liked that the furnishings had touches of mission style and seemed more updated than the usual hotel furniture in this price range. I was told the hotel is about 3 years old, so everything still looks new. Details like the gold mirror in the bathroom were nice. They don't skimp on towels either. I thought the water pressure was fine.
No airport noise to report, although we could hear guests in the next room and walking on the floor above.
The breakfast was disappointing. Not much selection. Along with the poor shuttle service, it's the reason I won't be returning. I'm willing to bet I can get more for my money elsewhere.",2

"Hotel 32 is an incredible hotel. I had a suite for my birthday. As they say you do get the call 3 days in advance sadly I didn't get it due to a phone issue but I did get and email from Joel letting me know that he tried to reach me. I called the phone number provided and got my limo pick up set up and my reservations set. When I arrived late to the airport my limo driver was waiting for me and I was whisked away to the hotel. I was greeted by the bellhop and took me and my luggage to the 32nd floor . I was greeted by Ricky and shown my room. My suite was way bigger than my room at home. The shower in my suite was bigger than the one at my house! The next morning (my birthday) I got to meet the most awesome Joel, the second I opened my door he turns my way and wishes me a happy birthday. Later on I received a phone call to my room from Joel to let me know I have a delivery and it was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and a card! Every suite assistant is just a delight to talk to and very helpful as well. Kimberley provided me with a plastic bag for the show I was going to see, and Joel giving me a huge menu book to give to my mom. If you're a female traveling alone, this is the hotel for you. It's safe, the key card entry in the elevator is great, and there's someone to talk to at the front desk. The lounge is a must the mini breakfast is wonderful and it's great for grabbing a soda or water to take with you when you want to go sight seeing. The night I got home (ah I'm just going to call it home) from the wicked spoon, I opened the door to find a bouquet of roses waiting for me (another B-day gift). I was speechless when I saw them.Joel is such a delight to talk to, he just has the most awesome stories to share. When you get a chance talk to Joel, he's there on the weekdays from ?-3pm. So when you have the money or if you can get a discount go to hotel 32 you won't be disappointed.",2
absolutely beautiful,2
"I went here today for lunch (strip location) after hearing several close friends and family members rave about it. I was not disappointed! It's very small and casual. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you - great for a quick, but delicious lunch. Everything is very fresh, to the point where you can see them carving GIANT fish on the counter and shipments of new fish constantly rolling in! (I think a server said they get shipments at least 3x a day.)\n\nI honestly wanted everything on the menu, but went with a bowl of swordfish bisque and crab cake sliders (served on a pretzel roll - sold!!) Both were delicious and I can't wait to go back! Someone next to us was eating sushi and I will probably have to try that ASAP.\n\nThe staff was all very friendly and service was quick also. Prices reasonable for the high quality fish served. \n\nIf you like fish, go here!",2

"This is amazing. The amazingness of this hotel falls into several categories:
Room: The room was beautiful, we got a ""view"" room that overlooked the library and could see all the way to Times Square. It was really thoughtfully laid out too: there was a fantastic chaise set up so you could lie down and gaze out at the city. The bathroom was really spacious, with his and hers sinks. The rain shower is absolutely fantastic. Ladies, a note, the light in the bathroom isn't super-bright, so might be better to put on makeup by the window. The temperature control was effective - when I wanted it warmer, it heated up quickly. I also appreciated the automatic curtains you could operate from a switch by the bed.
Food: This is the best room service food I have ever had in my life. Literally, the quality of the room service rivals most of the restaurants I've ever been in. Absolutely delicious. If I lived in this hotel, I'd be fat as all get-out from all the wonderful, wonderful food.
Staff: This is really what made it for me. We were running late for a show, and room service really went the extra mile to bring up our dinner in time even though they usually need 25 minutes at least..... it absolutely made my night. The check-in and check-out staff were thoroughly pleasant, and when I got stuck on a conference call that would not end, they graciously extended check out so I didn't have to hightail it out of my room while still on the phone.
Location: This is a great location, very convenient to shopping, shows, central park, great restaurants, and the subway if you want to venture farther afield. Not too far from Penn Station, if you're arriving via train.
This hotel and the other Andaz on Wall Street might be the only places I stay in New York from now on.....",2
i didn t know someone could have feelings that weren t sincere,2
"Run small
Not sure if my other belts run big or this is small. Probably get a size bigger than what you usually do.",2
"The food here seems to have been tailored to the western palate with mild flavours so if one is looking for 100% authentic peranakan food, you will not find it here. However, for what it is, the food is tasty and the ambience and service is faultless. A must-visit hotel for its beautiful ambience and decor. Steeped in tradition.",2
i feel so fab,2

i hadnt returned from the dentist feeling smug and good because at the age of nearly i was able to nip to the train station,2
It had been years since I stay at Le Parker Meridien because my annual conference chooses the hotel. This year I returned because of a bad experience at the conference hotel last year and I needed a change. So glad I did. The location is perfect for a quick jog in Central Park or a short walk to Times Square or shopping on Fifth Ave. The Burger Joint is great for that late night munchies and the brunch at Norma's was delightfully different and fulfilling. The staff was very helpful and friendly without being pretentious. The location is just enough off the park that the businesses near by are much more afforadable and it is easy to keep on budget.,2
i say i am on the healing side of grief i am not saying i do not still feel some losses in keen ways,2
"We stayed here one night with our 10 year old son on vacation. The hotel was clean, staff were beyond courteous (even changed my picky son's meal, no questions asked when he didn't like the pizza-kids eat free btw), and the location couldn't be beat for the value. We walked 2-3 blocks to everything we wanted to see. One thing to note: they only have 2 double beds, not 2 queen beds in the rooms. Still not a bad deal! We will stay there again!",2
Always a good experience. We have purchased many items from Richer Sounds over the years. Always good value and great advice,2
"From check into check out, we enjoyed our stay at the Roosevelt. The staff was friendly and professional. Despite other reviews here, our experence was wonderful.

i dont really know whether i feel the above situation is good or bad but its certainly an interesting effect from the way the gsoc process works,2
"We stayed at this Sheraton for 3 days at the end of hour brief tour of the NW and British Columbia. I reserved our room through the Priceline. At $75 per night, the price was unbeatable.
The hotel is located 6 long city blocks from the Market, most of it uphill. We love walking. Others would likely have to take a cab to the Warf, the Market, and the cruise terminal. This general area of the downtown was very busy, but felt safe both day and night. The convention center is located right next door. Many good restaurants and excellent shops are with in walking distance.
Our room was spacious and similar to other Sheraton hotels. Bedding was comfortable. Bathroom had all the usual amenities. Everything was very clean.
This hotel is huge with multiple towers. Because of that, the staff seems overwhelmed; the service is very impersonal. Late afternoon, long line forms at the check-in counter, cruise ship passengers, airline crews, and tour groups. The concierge desk fairs no better. We waited in line for half an hour. The concierge had only the most basic information and helped us little with local museums and transportation connections.
If you are heading to the airport, use the convenient shuttle that stops at the hotel.
Overall, if you want cheap, safe, modern, spacious, moderately convenient place in downtown Seattle consider this Sheraton. However, if you want charm, personal service, and helpful staff go somewhere else. This is not a place for romance.",2
This book was very interesting and has a great plot. The characters are complex without being hard to follow. I had to read the the rest of the books in this great story.,2
Fantastic authentic Mexican food! Wow. I got 2 carne asada tacos. Only $1.50 each. The meat was tender and flavorful. Not fatty at all. I also got a horchata. Delicious!\n\nGreat customer service. Very friendly. I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu.,2

"It's easy to see why many people consider In the Mood for Love to be Wong Kar-Wai's best film. The toned down appeal of the film, centering on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional ringer, is a retread into Happy Together territory but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of jarring film stocks and hyper-saturated sequences that have become a trademark of Kar-Wai's films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, this is a different kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are forsaken by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly confining emotional stasis.It's a testament to the genius of Kar-Wai that he is capable to making such a simple tale so resonating. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next-door to each other within the same apartment building. He's a journalist who dreams of publishing martial-arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. Their eventual coupling is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that Kar-Wai ambiguously paints such a journey with his grand masterstrokes.The key to the success of the film is Kar-Wai's use of the interior space, playing with foreground and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of Polanski. During the wooingly sensuous first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is concerned with environment and space here, creating a cramped emotional dynamic between his characters. It's also telling that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physicality of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen's spouses. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are tending to their own love affairs with each other.This is not to suggest that In the Mood for Love is a confining experience because Kar-Wai manages to inundate his film with broad splashes of hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow, sensual rise up a metaphorical stairway turns into Leung's descent down the very same stairwell; their movements perfectly compliment each other, bookending the shot and creating a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls have connected but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble fidelity.Other scenes in the film are punctuated with brief slow-motion shots of Cheung erotically moving through her interior surroundings, set to Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings. Her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable fusion between Li-szhen and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub-conscious.If I make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds unleashing pheromones on each other, it probably isn't that far-fetched of a statement. The tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the exteriors. The film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals. Kar-Wai continues to tease us even when the lovers get close enough to touch, shattering the couple's proximity to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within articles of clothing located inside of a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love lust, often unleashing a soft crest of rain over the characters after their bodies have glided near each other.Kar-Wai's hauntingly atmospheric shots of a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together, even if Leslie Cheung's Ho Po-wing was not there to enjoy it with him. By that film's end, love was so inextricably bound to the act of war that a third man's muted declarations of love signaled Yu-Fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if it would not bring him back his lover. Mo-Wan's journey terminates within the confines of a crumbling temple. His own emotional depletion is paralleled nicely with the political climate of his country, and the absence of Li-szhen is only made tolerable by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release of sorts. Mo-Wan caters to an ancient myth and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and heartache somehow served a higher purpose.",2

"My dogs - normally wonderfully behaved, absolute sweethearts - have a tendency to channel their inner stupid and forget how to use a doggy door the second a drop of rain hits the ground. As you may imagine, the rainy season here in Las Vegas makes for many frustrated moments at our house! \n\nDante came out today and did an absolutely wonderful job on our loft and stairs. The house carpet smells fresh and clean and looks brand new. He even came early and freed up two hours of my afternoon! I will definitely use them again. Thanks for the spectacular service!!",2
"Very good location & easy access to shops, subway, times square etc. The beds are extremely comfortable & rooms very clean. I rated the hotel 4 because there was no fridge or coffee maker in my room which was a standard room. The hotel needs to work on that & update amenities & decor.",2
"I would strongly recommend against staying in this hotel. I have travelled a lot, and slept in all types of hostels, boarding houses, bed & breakfasts and hotels - this is the worst place I've ever had the misfortune to stay at. The lobby is completely open to the public (overfowing from people just out of Penn Station looking for a place to take a break), the staff is rude, check-in takes forever, you have to use pre-paid wifi in the lobby (the signal didn't make it to my 3rd floor room). However the most unpleasant part of the stay has to do with the room itself. Windows can not be opened and haven't been washed in years, paint is chipped and peeling, rusty shower fixtures, the dark-brown carpet is scary, and there is a strange, musty, lingering smell that permeates everything. It's worth a visit downstairs to see the safety boxes - if I hadn't been travelling alone, I might have seen the humor in it all, but one look at the broken safe doors hanging on their hinges made me turn around, go back upstairs and hide my computer and passport in a drawer and hope for the best. The highlight of this horroric stay is a walk down the halls. The stained carpet and poor lighting are downright creepy (remember ""The Shining""?). There have got to be better places in the city for the money I paid. The location is the ONLY good thiing about it, however with the good subway system, what's the big deal about being right across the street from Penn Station?",2
"Just got back from my first visit and, after hearing from all my Chinese friends about how good it was, it did not disappoint. We were 7 people and shared an assortment of dishes: beef soup, whole chicken, sauteed beef with mushroom, whole lobster, whole fish in sweet and sour sauce, seafood on crispy noodles, large fresh scallop with garlic and ginger, and sweet tofu at the end. Everything was delicious and well presented. The service was very good and the restaurant itself is pretty clean and organized. Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in the Montreal area.",2
"The best waffles ever. I used to go almost every weekend with my family and now that we are not in Charlotte anymore, I miss it dearly. The service here is great as well.

"We recently took our kids to Austin for vacation and chose this hotel because we didn't want to deal with dirty hotel rooms, inadequate staff, bad food or untrained staff. We mad the right choice. The hotel is really elegant and the hotel staff superb. Even when there was a mix up with our room, they couldn't do enough to make it right and even sent up fruit, popcorn and drinks for the kids. The consierge staff was so great. They led us to the best boot store in town as well as an amazing rib and jazz place. It is also the only place I know where you ccan have a drink in a great lobby area and watch the famous congress ave bridge bats take flight. The only and I stress only dissapointment was the pool. Constuction going on next door made the pool area very unpleasant.",2
"I read reviews for hotels in the Mission Valley area as I had stayed at two other chain hotels in that area but was disappointed by both of them. You will not be disappointed by this hotel. I was greeted quickly by friendly and efficient staff and got my room earlier than normal check-in time. My room – a king-sized bedroom – was very spacious and very clean. The bathroom was immaculate and stocked with necessities. What I didn’t bring was available with a quick call – razor, toothpaste, etc. The room offers a large closet, safe, full sized mirror, good lighting, desk area, coffee maker (tea selections were not great) and comfortable chair. The hotel is located right across from the trolley stop making it very convenient to get around San Diego. The bar was comfortable – Gibson is a great bartender. The pool area is clean and has lots of room for enjoying the great sunshine SD t has. There is a fitness center that I didn’t have time for but I will use the next time. Breakfast is available and prices aren’t too bad. Down sides – parking is expensive and no free wi-fi in the room.",2

We got a virus-filled laptop AND desktop totally cleaned up in about an hour. It is so convenient that they do housecalls, so I dont have to lug my desktop into some store.

"We visited this store the day after Christmas 2014 to do a pretty complicated transaction, adding two new iPhones to my parent's account, which was just basic phones with no data, so we would all be on one shared plan. The employee walked us through all our options, helped us calculate the plan that was cheapest for us for what we wanted, and although the US Cellular back-office system remains a mess (it took over an hour to get the logistics of the new lines completed), the staffer was very conscious of our time and even told us to go get lunch while he worked everything out. Much, much better than the US Cell stores we've visited elsewhere in Madison.",2

A group of three ladies for a 50th birthday celebration enjoyed a very smooth flight to Singapore and received exceptional customer service from the airline attendants. They just couldn't do enough for us and went that extra mile to look after us. The food was some of the best I've had on an international flight and combined with a very streamlined check in service it was fantastic! I was so impressed that my husband and I are now flying with Singapore in August for our trip to UK!,2
"KA was amazing! I loved the beats and music from the entire show! Almost wanted to buy the cd but didn't. I had pretty awesome seats about 10 rows back from the stage. I loved the tribal cultured theme performances throughout the show. It was awesome that they actually took the crowd into a journey through a story in the show. I loved the sets, the costumes, and all of the elements that came together to make a spectacular show. This is a must see! It may be a little pricey but worth every penny.",2
"Stayed for 3 nights last week of Sept. Nice little hotel 10 mins walk to Union Square.
We stayed in a double double room and the room was a decent size with a huge walk in closet, chest of drawers in the room, a desk and chair. The beds were comfy and there were extra pillows and blankets in the closet. The bathrooms was fine, shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Just be warned that there isn't a bathroom fan, we opened the window. Also, we visited during a mini heat wave and there was no air-con, but we kept the window open and the ceiling fan going. It worked out fine.
We didn't hear very much hotel noise (from other guests) just sounds of the city with the windows open.
The staff were fantastic and really make the hotel. The evening wine reception was a nice touch.
Also the restaurant next door (Fly) has great pizza and sangria.",2
"Stayed during busy season and this is VERY close to the Space Needle but the rooms just are not up to the cost ($12.00 parking is also added to your bill) of $145.00. Overall the staff was very polite and friendly, my wake-up call was missed but the manager was very nice about it and offered to discount the room. My room (King Single) was VERY small and though not dirty it was WORN. TV was old and had a bad picture. On the good side the Bed and Bedding where very nice and the air conditioner was brand new. If all your looking for is a place to sleep and shower this hotel has a great location and compared to the surrounding hotels of the same-ish caliber it MAY be your best value.",2
"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. I loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which stayed, hauntingly, in my head. It was an interpretation of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something Catherine herself would have loved. And oh to be loved by this passionate Henry! This was the Henry of Catherine's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and which was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one. I wonder if Jane was being entirely satirical in her novel. Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a Henry. I haven't seen the film in many years, at least a decade. But, I have been yearning for it ever since.",2
"Almost perfect (for the intro level it was designed for). I would suggest that next time, if possible, instructor image could be a little smaller and the actual images illustrating the points he is talking about a little bigger and more diverse. But that is a minor, please, dont get me wrong. The course was very very good, thank you a lot. Also, the off-line written forum-style discussions were very very good.",2

"We got a great rate by booking from the SPG website, so we started off on a good foot. When we got to the hotel, it was packed with lots of families, so it was a long checkin process, but again, worth the wait. Asked for and got a renovated room, which was great again. The breakfast was fine, the club floor access was super, except that again, crowded with lots of families...the poor staff looked overwhelmed. Some families were letting their kids run around without supervision, which put stress on other guests and of course the staff. The pool was fine, but a bit too small for the 4th largest hotel in the city. Location was terrific, we walked everywhere. Parking was expensive, but it was the same price all over town, so park at the hotel.",2
"Helpful,however there is a problem with other locations..",2
"This was a great trip. We had a great view from the second floor. We enjoyed watching the river boats, also the people traveling the riverwalk. The hotel staff was very nice. Our rooms were clean and the air conditioner worked well. We used the hotel parking. It was expensive, but we felt our car was secure. The pool was very nice. Our granddaughter enjoyed it very much. It was not too noisy where our rooms were after 10.00. It was really nice to walk from the hotel to the riverwalk.",2
"better than most modern GPS's only issue is its buggy. i went on a 5 hour trip, and it was constantly changing. i ended up taking the shorter route. when i wanted the longer route (5 mins longer) as the longer route is safer. how this happened is i accidentally closed the app, but it still saved where i was going, so i thought it was fine, turns out, it re-routed me. this is more of my fault then the app's fault. still annoying though. and it would show the speed limit in some areas, not all.",2
"This place is 100% a 5-Star place, however, only if you pass this quiz:\n\nChinese food I eat most is:\na. Chow Mein\nb. Fried Rice\nc. Lemon Chicken\nd. Broccoli Beef\ne. All above but with brown rice\nf. Steamed Rock Cod with scallion, oil and soy sauce.\n\n\n\nIf you picked \""F\"", then read on below. If you picked a-e, then this place will be a THREE-STAR for you and you are better off going to PF Chang, Pei Wei or Panda.\n\nFor any of you picking \""F\"", you will know this place is pretty darn good and well worth a 5 star.\n\na. The place - This place is a just the right size. Perhaps 10 -11 tables and also a separated area with two very large banquet tables. I can see this place would be busy at dinners and for lunch it was just right.\n\nb. The service - I know I was in a real cantonese place because of the service. I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency. However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.\n\nc. The FOOD -\n\n- You know you are in the right place when at the front door is a large fish tank with dozens of rock cod in the tank and also another tank with huge geoduck in it. Yeah baby. Let's get ready to rock it.\n\n- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book. The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.\n\n- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon. If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy. The black bean sauce was just the right amount ant the ribs were cut to about an inch or so and was perfect! When I first moved to LV, I could not find this at any Chinese restaurant so I learned how to make it and at KJ, I love it!\n\n- Steamed Chicken with Scallion and Ginger - Now I did not see this on their menu, and they had similar items that were fried, but I needed mine the authentic steamed method. I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out. The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby! Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. \n\nd. Overall - You know you are in a really authentic Cantonese restaurant when you see the following:\n\n- The Shovel Method - Yep, that is right. You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite. You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth. By the way, no soy sauce on the rice. When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.\n\n- The Boney Plates. Yeah, not \""china\"" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone. The bonier the better. You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!\n\n- Oh yeah, no silverware. Come on. How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me. BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick? I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls. Shovel method. That is the way to go!\n\nGK says, check this place out. If you see someone making a ton of noise and gushing all over the bones on his plate. Check him out. That could be ME!",2
I stay at 4 Points Sheratons pretty often. This is the nicest one I have stayed in. The hotel was just redone and has a extremely modern and classy feel to it. The service was excellent and the beds were comfortable. They have a great bar with good beer selection and great happy hour during the week. The pool is small if your looking for that. You have to pay for breakfast but it is fair for the price. IHOP is next door though!,2

"Check in staff at Seoul Incheon were unenthusiastic and seemed bored to be at work. My flight was rescheduled from Manila to Cebu and they reluctantly put me on the flight before as they told me to wait until I arrived in Manila but in 4.5 hours time maybe the early flight would have been full with others that had the same idea as me. Nice flight to Manila, when I arrived in Manila we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes as they couldn't connect the air bridge to the aircraft. Luckily the Manila to Cebu flight was delayed so I had an extra 25 minutes, the security staff at budget terminal 4 were unbelievably rude. The second A320 we were on to Cebu was so old. The only saving grace was the always great onboard service.",2
"Very helpfull course! A bit dry (or is that just a Dutch phrase?), but good information. Learned a lot about my learning in the past and why certain things worked and others didnt.

"The Kimpton chain always offers a great value and some fun decor. My room was immaculately clean. The room was a little on the small side, but not a problem and it had all the ammenities (including thick furry leopard print robes - yikes!! Helloooo Mr. Hefner :-)
The bed was extremely comfortable and if you request a bay view room, you will be treated to a gorgeous view of the water and the Bay Bridge. I was on the 4th floor facing the bay and could not hear any noise from the street below. They have a wine reception each evening. The staff was very efficient and friendly.
I had stayed at another hotel in this area a few years ago and I really like the location. There are many excellent restaurants on the surrounding blocks, the Ferry Terminal building is just a block away and it has many food shops and restaurants. It is a bit of a walk to get to Fisherman's Wharf (perhaps a mile?), but it is a very picturesque and flat stroll. You can also walk about a mile in the other direction and get to the baseball stadium and the bars and restaurants that are in that neighborhood. The waterfront also makes a great spot for runners. Be prepared for the $42 per night parking fee - but that is fairly typical of hotels in large cities.

"This film is on my top 20 comedies list. This is a truly unique film. To the reviewer who said ""I must be really missing something.""--you are correct. You are missing something. If you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires, that's one thing. But don't give it a bad review because you think it's ""looney"" but isn't intended to be. Loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being. I laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than I do at most other funny films.Michael Almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this, his first big film, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now. Harry Dean Stanton puts in an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally cast, and Lois Chiles is completely excellent.All of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way, but this is one of Crispin's finest performances--up there with his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you are a Crispin Glover fan, but have somehow overlooked this film, you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately.But just remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great film, but it is very unusual, and I recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing.",2

"Very nice plates! Would recommend
Plates arrived packaged well. No chips or cracks and the printing on the plates is done well, no flaws or messed up printing. With some plate holders these made awesome displays for my wife's rooster country kitchen",2
"I was extremely happy with my meal here. The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy. I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo. The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips. I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping. The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial. After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans. \n\nI was equally happy with the atmosphere and service. I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner. Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars. I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.",2
"All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, ""This movie is hilarious, go check it out!"" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, ""If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down,"" is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, ""more videogames than an Asian kid,"" and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an ""it's OK to wait"" message.But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.",2
LOVE this app so far!! Its helping me a lot<3,2
"Let's start with location - who could ask for anything better than this hotel offers. Easy walk to the Park, Columbus Cir, Times Square, etc. Additionally, the hotel has an extremely sophisticated look and rooms that, by NYC standards at least, are quite large. As far as the logistics of a hotel- cleanliness, promptness of service, navigatability, etc. - I have nothing but praise for them. Oh, and I found the staff to be professional, personable and courteous. I had a brief stay this trip but look forward to booking a room at the Park Central when I can stay a little longer.",2
"Sooooo Late with this review(again, I'm always late lol) \n\nI stayed at the Signature last year for my 25th birthday. Me and my boys originally booked the MGM, but were moved to Signature for an upgrade. Wow, wow,wow! \n\nCheck in was quick, staff was extra friendly..and the rooms.. here we go\n\nWe got two rooms one JR and one bed room. They were next to each other so that was a plus. Of course since it was my birthday, I got the big room! In total we had 3 bathrooms, which was an ultimate plus seeing as my friends are a bunch a male divas lol. Kitchen was great. We bought liquor and thanks to the blender, we were able to make our own beverages. The balcony was great as it over looked Wet Republic(see my other review). The room was very spacious. I help my own pre game party there with 8 other people including my friends. We did have security come up once, music was too loud, but not a biggie.\n\nI booked for MDW this year, I can't wait!",2

And I'll leave it at that. \n\nThe acrobats truly put out a great show with gravity defying stunts.\n\nWe paid top dollar for front seats and it was worth every penny.",2

Regular traveller on Qantaslink. Snacks on all services good. I find the leg room great and the seats quite comfortable although there is a small recline. All my flights have been on time. Usually fly out of Dubbo Albury or Brisbane. Crew love to have long chats in the galley while customers sitting with rubbish on tray table waiting to be collected. Standards have dropped over the last couple of years. From chewing gum to no smiles you just expect it now.,2
Really this restaurant is very good and all the employees serve the food with great care and many thanks to Debashish Da. I have been to this restaurant many times. The decoration of this restaurant is really amazing.😊,2

"Easy and budget friendly fix for your mower
Purchased this to revive a Toro Recycler mower that would not start after a year in storage. Tried starting fluid and it would run for a second or two on that which told me the carb was likely gummed up with stale gas. Completed the swap in less than an hour including the time to get the tools out and clean up. Very easy job; numerous YouTube videos out there to guide the process. Seems to be OEM quality at fraction of the cost. At this price it doesn’t make sense to waste time on carb rebuild and obviously far cheaper and easier than taking it to the shop, if you can even find a place that works on small engines. Received quickly and packaged well.",2
"We had our second stay at the Affinia Hotel in Jan 2012 and it was even better than the first time. The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location. The rooms are very clean/tidy and are very modern. The staff are very friendly at all times and always keen to help or give advice.
Me and my partner got engaged out in NY and the hotel found out about this, on the very same evening when we went back to our room they had surprised us with Champagne, chocolates and rose petals all over the room it was absolutely beautiful! Thank you to Ashley, Jenny, Liz and Alic for making are stay and engagement unforgettable!!",2

"Salon Bossa Nova is as good as it gets when it comes to cuts and customer service. I've been going to SBN now since early last summer. There's never any doubt what I'm going to get when I'm there. \n\nMy stylist, Cassie, is always on time, doesn't talk my ear off, gives a very relaxing hair wash, knows what to do with my hair without asking, and is passionate about her craft. She consistently does a great job. \n\nThe salon, if I'm not mistaken, also offers a wide range of services. I'm pretty confident that every one of the services and stylist are great. If you're close to them and you get a chance to try them let me know what you think. \n\nNote: I submitted a request to yelp to update their address.

"I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights and chose it primarily because it was close to my work sight. The staff were AMAZING! First night I got in, the wonderful lady at the front desk agreed (very easily) to upgrade me to a higher floor. Not only did I get a higher floor, but it also allowed me access to the very cute club lounge and outdoor roof top. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and helpful! The location is fantastic; A 30 minute walk to the meatpacking district and a short cab ride to all other attractions. The room had a gorgeous view of the city. I was proposed to on the rooftop terrace and I'm glad it was at this hotel because I will definitely be returning to the hotel! The housekeeping staff even left a sweet handwritten note in the room for me! Absolutely a wonderful place to stay!!!!!!",2
"High end unit
I go to many customer locations over a large area. With this unit, I save them as a favorite and can always get there as fast as possible. I use my phone a lot so I don't want to use my phone. Besides, the separate GPS unit does the job more efficiently. But Garmin has made it so transferring favorites is easy with their Express but it only does a partial job. I'm having to re-enter a number of customers. Also, volume is not as loud as my model 50. Otherwise, it's just getting used to different placement of icons. And why did you change favorites to a heart?",2

"This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel while visiting DC and I can't imagine looking for any better of a hotel. This is not your typical Four Points, the quality and decor is much more chic and urban than your average suburban Four Points. I was surprised by the amenities this hotel offered, the new fitness center is beautiful! I've seen other limited service hotels nearby at the same price that don't offer the same level of amenities for much more in price.
The location and ease of access to all of the major downtown points of interet could not be more convenient. There is always someone outside to hail a cab, or the metro is only a couple blocks away that connects you to almost all the major metro lines. The rooms are great size for being a prime downtown location where I'm sure real esetate is limited. From the moment I walked into the hotel, we felt very appreciated and respected throughout the entire hotel, I highly recommend this hotel for anyone who does business in DC, has a convention nearby, or is leisurely visiting for the weekend, it was a wonderful stay.",2

"Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers.",2

"envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be, but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for, now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever, so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear, obviosly ben wants no part of it, but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy, its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt, but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times, as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun, give it a watch",2

"The ""Suite Celebration"" promotion could not be turned down ; we would have loved going back to the Four Seasons, but with a price tag in excess of $1100+ for the smallest room at the time of our stay, we decided to try a new place instead.
New might not be the right word, though, to qualitly this stately Grande Dame towering over Central Park. Everybody that counted in the 20th century stayed there; you can feel it, like being handed a chance to stay there.
We had booked a Premier One-Bedroom Suite, and were allocated one on the 27th floor. A corner suite, really large, probably larger tha our Paris flat, with the focus on the living room and bed room, which were huge. Beautiful city views to the east from both, with an extra voew to the south from the bedroom. Massive heavenly bed. Admittedly, the bathroon the bathroom was on the smaller side, still with a tub and a separate shower stall, but no separate WC. Those were the days ... Bathroom perfectly up to date, with great pressure, wonderful full size Molton Brown amenities.
Housekeeping is fantastic : it was never to be seen, and did a beautiful job.
Nice friendly operators in the elevators, some of which could use better airconditionning (the elevators, not the operators).
Fantastic concierge whi went out of ther way to locate some stores, and did some follow up on it when we got back. They seem interested !
Both on check-in and out, valet obliged and hold our rental car for a little while, not actually taking it away.
Breakfast is good, but the selection is limited. No smoked salmon bagel in the ciy where it was created.
Drawbacks ? Not really. We checked in on my birthday, and although I had made it clear when booking, this was never acknowledged in any way. There is one house car, probably a single one, which was NEVER available to us : it had either just left, of was stuck somewhere ; and when it was parked in front, the driver could not be located. And last, why is it that none of the non signature suite has a park view ? Or perhaps non of them was available ib the Suite celebration.",2

Good quality mug. I ordered two at different times. Both came wrapped in thin cheap bubble wrap and thrown in a box with other items. One made it to me safely, the other did not.

"I arrived at the hotel at 10pm after a tiring flight from New York. The check in was prompt and the staff were very helpful. My room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking Cyril Magnin Streeet and it was quite noisy, but it was Saturday night so would expect more noise than usual. The room was quite small, with a queen size bed which was so comfortable. Bathroom was a good size, and water was nice and hot in the shower. Plenty of lovely fluffy towels. I had a little problem with the T.V and rang to the front desk and within 10 minutes a handyman knocked at my door and the problem was fixed. The interior of the hotel was charming, lovely colour schemes. I stayed in this room for 3 nights and after the Saturday night noise didn't hear anything outside for the following 2 nights. I checked out for the next 2 nights and staff stored my large suitcase, as I didn't need it, . free of charge. Checked back in for 1 night and this time was given a room on the 5th floor. This room was almost double the size, again a very comfortable bed and lovely hot shower. I did feel that the included breakfast on the mezzanine floor was a little unappealing, but most mornings I just had this and chose to buy something more substantial later in the day. I did utilize the small caafe next to the lobby on a number of occasions. I felt that the location of this hotel was fantastic, right in the heart of the shopping district, a couple of blocks from Union Square, close to the public transport system which I used on a number of times to travel to Fishermans Wharf, and the Alcatraz Pier 33 (F trolley car at a cost of only $2 one way) and the cable car turn around right outside the front door. This was my first trip to San Francisco and I chose this hotel from an on-line search and I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Look, at the end of the day, all I want is a comfy bed, a hot shower and courteous, friendly hotel staff and I reckon I got all these things with this hotel. After all, I was out all day doing the tourist things and I didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel. I will definately stay at this hotel again!",2

"Very innovative redesign of former jail - enough of the prior jail remains to get a true feel for the central cell block. Clearly one of the pricey Boston Hotels but seems to be worth it. Would rate staff a full 10 of 10. Lobby scene later night is worth watching although unclear how long the current ""It Place"" will remain so. Somewhat concerned that the rocking lobby bar would impact ability to sleep but there was zero transmitted noise. Similar concern about arriving ambulances at Mass General but once again not an issue. Our room was not one of the rooms with a view but it was comfortable and nice. Location is excellent as it sits at the base of Charles Street - the trendy uphill walk up to Beacon Hill. Also easy walk to North End, Boston Garden and Fan. Hall area.",2

Wharf - down the street, Knuckles sports bar - a couple blocks up and around the corner (beware poor to sketchy service on this last visit), Cable Car turn - around 10 min walk, nifty little stores to bring goodies!

"What happened to Ava Gardner in the 1940s and Marilyn Monroe in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress Michelle Pfeiffer in the '80s: Her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. Anyone looking for validation of Pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's ""Frankie and Johnny"" or '92's ""Love Field"" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988's ""Married to the Mob."" In this one, she plays Angela Demarco, the widow of a recently ""iced"" Mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky Long Island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by Mob boss Dean Stockwell and FBI man Matthew Modine. While this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director Jonathan Demme's previous effort ""Something Wild""; and hilarious yet menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), Michelle steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails Angela's undereducated, Long Island Italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. Once upon a time, long ago, Oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. Had this film been made 60 years ago, Michelle mighta been a contenduh...",2

Tortillas are handmade which makes it even more awesome so let's add more stars.shrimp Coctel is a plus and the tacos is just yum yum crazy. love the chile rellenos but not a fan for the red sauce but decided to try it and it's actually pretty good, kids loved the quesadilla, so if your looking for a new frequent place to eat this would be the spot.",2

"A Malacca friend recommended we try this restaurant on our first night in historic Malacca. The last time I was in Malacca was in 2011 and many new eateries have since been added. This is one of them.The Samfu Restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Mimosa Hotel and if you are driving, there are ample parking lots. But you really needn't drive there if you live in the old historic quarter of Malacca. It would be within walking distance.The restaurant is tastefully set up, with touches of old and new. It is air-conditioned but isn't too cold.The menu is well presented and the food selection is quite wide. As there were only three of us, we couldn't order too many dishes. Upon consultations with restaurant manager Jenny, we ordered the following:1 Nyonya chup chye. A perennial favourite of mine but hard to get decently cooked ones in most restaurants. It is a stew of various vegetables (cabbage, lily buds, black fungus, mushrooms, tang hoon or bean vermicelli, dried strips of beancurd skin and the chef of Samfu added extras such as cauliflower, carrot, broccoli), cooked in a broth of pork, fermented soy beans (tau cheo), garlic, onion, some sugar, pepper and salt. The myriad flavours and seasoning were well balanced and the vegetables fresh and not cooked to death. 2. Udang Masak Nanas (prawns in a pineapple curry). The prawns were fresh, the meat firm not soft. The pineapple curry was excellent. Not too spicy and bursting with layers upon layers of flavourful spices plus a dash of sourness. Just this dish and a plate of hot white rice would have suffice. A tongue-swallowing dish!3. Bendi (Lady's Fingers, okra) with Sambal. Here, I thought the chef was experimenting as the sambal that topped the dark-green vegetables looked interestingly complex. Usually, one gets a simpler belachan (fermented shrimp paste) dip or a dollop of sambal. As you can see in the photo it has fried shallot and onion rings, perhaps even slivers of lemongrass, fried garlic covering the sambal. A squeeze of lime and the dish was complete. 4. Chilli Garam Babi (pork). Another interesting dish. The pork belly meat was finely cut into small pieces and fried with another heady mixture of chillies and spices and garnished with fragrant coriander leaves. It was, however, a tad too salty for my taste, but if eaten with white rice, it's okay.Looking forward to try their other dishes on my next visit.* The chef, Keong, is not a Baba by the way, but he is an excellent cook and has picked up the nyonya recipes well. You can taste his passion in his dishes.",2

"We stayed 6 nights and could easily have stayed many more.
There is a service ethic that runs through the staff that is magnificent. From the concierge staff who greet you each time you walk though the front door, to the front desk, restaurant staff and house maids there is a consistent desire to provide wonderful service whilst making you feel comfortable in a home away from home manner.
From the complimentary ""refreshment centre"" ( ie fridge stocked with water, juice and soft drinks) to the observant house maid who noticed we were almost outoftoothpaste and so provided a new one, there were just so many lovely little touches. It's the little things that make a stay particularly memorable.
Room tip: join Leading Hotels of he World and you will stand a good chance of getting a room upgrade whilst being assured of continental breakfast and free Wifi. If you don't do this may I encourage you to get a rate that includes breakfast especially if you like a full breakfast asit can be quite pricey.

"Made the same year as the first Lumiere films, this is a much more dramatic short than the brothers attempted until the following year's 'Niagara'. The surviving print is very rough, but this only adds to the Turneresque visual violence, as huge surges of water dash against a stolid pier, and seem ready to engulf the camera, the viewer.If you watch a number of these early shorts in chronological order, and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is a further shock in that, unlike the single frame set-ups of the Lumieres, this film features an edit, which for me at any rate, was as slashing as the razor blade in 'Un Chien Andoulu).Unlike the mono-vision of the Lumieres' films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, eluding its grasp in a way the Lumieres never could. The second shot features a similar gush to that of Niagara, but is less frightening because, by way of the edit, we have sidestepped the danger. In a film like 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', nature stands indifferent and powerful, uncontainable by the camera. Basic film grammar puts an end to its supremacy.",2

The hotel rooms are immaculate and while being on the small side have contemporary furnishings including a fridge, flat screen tv, micorwave and coffee maker. Very comfy beds. The location is perfect..only about a block or two off Times Square. The hotel does have an adjacent restaurant and bar but has lots of options right across 8th Avenue, including a Mexican, Chinese and Greek restaurant as well as a Starbucks and pizza place. Our next visit to New York will definitely include a stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. One other thing, we arrived at 11:35AM and our room was ready!!!",2

"As others have said, this hotel is for those who want to get away from the generic chains. If you want a standard tourist experience, you can get GREAT deals with last minute online bidding. If you like staying in b&bs or european style pensiones, this place is for you.
There are very few hotels in this part of town. I used to go the geary parkway motel which has a 1960s drive in motel feeling. Since one of the employees was downright cruel to me, I will never patronize them again. please pick Stanyan Park over Geary Parkway if you have a choice!
few of the reviewers mention that this hotel has been in continuous operation since 1894. if you like that vibe [with a 1980s redecoration] you will love this! Pretend you are a victorian salesman passing through SF. Imagine how early 20th century people would stay here after outings to GG park.
I think the other reviews show more about the reviewers than the hotel. One British reviewer said this reminded her of downwardly mobile seaside hotels in Britain - wow I have never been to a seaside hotel in Britain, and now I guess I don't have to try that! Another guy said he was mad because he had no air con. Dude, this is SF. It is cool every day of the year. Thank your lucky stars you visited SF on a hot day! Next time stay downtown in a chain!
Please try this hotel if you like something different. The room/bathroom/breakfast quality is fine - few hotels offer breakfast more than muffins and here they at least had eggs and bagels etc. they also offer teatime in the pm. I stayed in a single inward looking room - small but quiet. Yes I could see into other rooms - I saw someone in their underwear closing their blind at night! hahahaha. But the interior rooms are quiet.
email me if you have any questions about any hotels in SF and how to get good deals. the worst part of this hotel is that they do not offer last minute specials and you cannot bid for this neighborhood on places like hotwire or priceline. You pay a bit more for the unique experience.
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PUBLIC TRANSIT HERE! PARKING IS 18$ AND IT IS SUPER CONVENIENT TO MUNI LINE N JUDAH!",2
"Housekeeping dropped the ball--no bottled water, no coffee packets, no toiletries, dirty towels on sink counter and small table.........called the Care-line requesting replenishment and also mentioned problem to front desk.......dirty towels removed, but not replaced, toiletries supplied, no water, no coffee....someone should have inspected room to ensure room was ready for occupants........front desk did offer a different room, we declined as we thought this was a quick fix........bad assumption..............on return trip, we were comp'd to an upgrade.........very nice room........and a very nice gesture.........we almost canceled but decided one bad stay didn't necessarily mean no more stays......glad we returned............convenient, free shuttle w/8 pieces of luggage, pretty gardens, friendly staff",2
it's so awesome 👍😎,2
"The room was everything we'd hoped for - and then some. Between the stainless steel sink and fixtures in the bathroom, the luxurious down bedding and warm decor in general, it was very appealing and cozy. I slept like a rock in that bed. The staff was impressive, most notable the Concierge named Jason. He was phenomenal!! He got us 5th row seats to see Blue Man Group (on a Saturday night) with less than 24 hrs notice. He was extremely helpful and because of him we ate like kings in some of the best restaurants in the area. We would definitely stay there again.
The location was very convenient. Close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and great shopping. If you're into sightseeing, it's conveniently close to the Waldord Astoria which is where you can catch a free shuttle to the docks for one of the sightseeing cruises, sightseeing tour buses also stop here to pick up riders. Anyone who knows how much is costs to take a cab from one side to town to the other will appreciate the free shuttle.
Great hotel!!",2
Came here for a kolachi but only the northern location has them. Oh well. But still enjoyed the maple bacon donut and the sprinkle donut. Not good for the diet but good for the soul. The lady behind counter was super sweet and nice. Really liked the friendly atmosphere.,2

"When I was in college at CMU, Larry & Carol's was a main part of my diet. In addition to having 5 phone lines (so you could always get through), they were open till 3am doing brisk delivery business on campus with their delicious toasted sandwiches and pizza. \n\nThese days when I'm back in da 'Burgh to visit the parental units, I always stop off at Larry & Carols and pickup a footlong sandwich for old time's sake!",2
"We stayed at this hotel as the 3rd part of our honeymoon. When we arrived the staff were super friendly and very helpful, we were upgraded to a room with a King Sized bed which was just perfect. The rooms are spotless and the coffee making facility is excellent. They even put some really fancy soaps, body wash, shampoo etc in the rooms and replenish these every day.
We were welcomed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The hotels location wasn't too bad it was a short walk to 7th Street to jump on the Metro underground $5 for a day ticket which can be used on buses as well and such a simple transport system to use, England could learn a thing or two. We just loved LA our favorite place ever! My only comment regarding the hotel would be that they try to charge you $9 a night for wi-fi if you go on line and sign up to their loyalty programme which is free of charge the wi-fi will be complimentary,",2
"Heathrow To Colombo seat numbers 36a and 36c. The cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful, the screen was not working in 36a and cabin crew tried a lot to sort out the issue .. it came once after their several attempts and then it didn't work consistently, but greatly appreciate the effort that they put and it was something out of their control. Also they gave a nice service and other members in the crew was willing to help for anything we requested. Food was OK though it was a fixed menu for veg and non veg. Would like to propose more PPI (kind of apron that they can use and throw away after each service) to the crew in this pandemic. Cleaning of the table is not acceptable.",2
Have been using Wex for trade-ins and purchases for quite some time and this time the experience was stellar as usual. Will continue to use Wex and highly recommend them to everybody.,2
"So my girlfriend and I decided to go out for girls night and check out this new spot for dinner. We had no idea what to expect as we had never seen the place before, but we knew it had to be good if it was anything like the mission. Well it was so much more than that! It was the cutest little place set in an old historic house with a charming candelight patio and the hugest tree I had ever seen sprawling over the place! \n\nWe were greated and told a bit about the menu and drinks after we were sat outside in front of the lovely old fireplace. I chose the watermelon cooler and my friend went with a margarita of some kind. OMG those drinks were to die for!!! the watermelon cooler was so so good and I could have drank that all night! We then decided to share a few things for small plates. We ordered the brisket biscut which just melted in your mouth and was packed with flavor! We then had the crab dip which was absolutely delicious and creamy and the bread was toasted to perfection. Then our absolute favorite was the duck confit meatballs. These were thee best meatballs ever! Crispy on the outside soft on the inside and there was a serious explosion of flavors that I cannot even describe!\n\nIt was so good we went for brunch the next day and let me tell you that was amazing as well. Do yourself a favor and treat your palate at the House Brasserie!",2

A SHOW TO SEE WHILE YOUR IN VEGAS!!! the show was simply mind blowing....im not going to give any secrets away in this review....you just have to go see it =)),2
"My husband and I really enjoyed our four night stay at the Hyatt Regency August 28-September 1. I booked with my AAA card for the rate of 119 for 3 nights and the last night was around 135 without taxes. I asked for a king sized non-smoking room, without no connecting door, and a room on a high floor to avoid the street noise. We ended up staying on the 14th floor facing Market Street and had no problems with street noise. I would ask for a high floor room if you are concerned with street noise and let them know that when you check in at the front desk. I explained that I was somewhat a light sleeper and needed a room that wouldn't be too noisy.
Transportation- I was so amazed that when we arrived from the BART the hotel was right there. We exited the BART station and walked up the steps and could see the hotel. I had no idea it would be that close. The MUNI bus and one of the cable cars is also right there. We used the MUNI and the BART. We used public transportation the entire time on our trip. The ride from the SFO airport on the BART was about a half hour.
Room- The room was somewhat small, but it wasn't too bad for two people. The room was clean and the bed was very comfy!! Rooms were taken care of daily. One thing I found a little strange when we arrived at the hotel is that there was pee in the toilet and toilet paper. I asked the front desk about this and they explained someone from housekeeping would make sure the bathroom was cleaned.
Food- We ate two mornings at the Noah's Bagels below the hotel. Walgreen's, Starbucks, Taco Bell Express, and a place called Burger Bistro (serves breakfast & lunch) is directly across the street. There are also many other food selections at the Ferry Station across the street. We ate at a very good Mexican Restaurant there one night.
Location- You are mainly in the Financial District so it seems like most things were closed around 9-10 pm it seemed. Chinatown is about a 15 minute walk away and a 3 minute bus ride.
Overall- I really enjoyed my stay here at the hotel and would definitely stay here again when we visit. The front desk staff were extremely friendly and would go out of their way to help you. The hotel does offer a breakfast buffet each morning for the cost of around 25 per person. There is also a bar in the lobby area also. The glass elevators were fun and we never had to wait on them.",2

"Like its functionality
I carry this back and forth for my massage sessions. It's nice to keep my oils organized and fairly easy to wipe out if they leak a little in side the bag while transporting. Hard part is getting bottles out from the end slots. It's a tighter spot with the material to try to maneuver items in and out. Otherwise, I like the bag and other therapists have commented on it as well.",2
"Across from the Capitol and via skywalks connected to the Convention Center and Shopping Mall (and then seemingly everything else).
Starbucks in the hotel lobby, but not 24 hours; and the only restaurant is a steakhouse ( so on the pricier side). Better off doing the 10 minute walk to Downtown. At the time of my stay the gym was being renovated...
Room of the standard sort; although the bathrooms were smaller than usual.
I was on the Club Floor and the Lounge there had a smaller selection of food items that usual Starwood Lounges.
For the price and the endless number of hotels on the area, I an not sure it was the best deal around. The hotel itself was good; however, again the price seemed high for what I received.",2
"This hotel is in a great location for Fisherman's Wharf and lots of transport options. Plenty of cafes nearby and lots of sightseeing. Complimentary breakfast was good, room was comfortable and front office staff were very helpful in assisting us with transport arrangements to US Open. We had a great stay in San Francisco and would recommend this hotel.",2
i could go on but i feel ive entertained enough for today,2
"Follow travel procedures carefully I traveled with them on the A350-900 from Cairo to Chengdu. Due to travel restrictions in China, there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to China with Sichuan Airlines. The ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand US dollars (for a one-way ticket from Cairo to Chengdu). It is difficult to buy tickets online, and you can buy them easily if you know someone in China who can buy them for you, or through the company's page on WeChat. If you are traveling from a third country to Egypt to travel with them, you must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) three times within 48 and twenty-four hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in that country, and if the result of the virus tests is negative, the Chinese embassy will give you Green light to travel to Egypt. Upon arrival in Cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to China from Cairo, and then they will add you to the group of travelers on WeChat, you must have an account on WeChat. You must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in Cairo (they will give you the address, and name of the laboratories, and the date and time of the tests on WhatsApp). The first PCR test is conducted forty-eight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning. If the result of the PCR test is positive, they will add you to another group on WeChat, and you cannot travel. If the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you, and you must do the test again on the day of travel. On the day of travel, the flight departs at around four o'clock in the afternoon. You must go to the laboratory to do a PCR test at exactly four o'clock in the morning. If the result of your examination is positive, they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on WeChat, if the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures. 7-You should apply for the Electronic Health Codes. You can fill in the information, declare your health status and upload relevant documents online. You must obtain it before traveling, and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the Sichuan Airlines counter at Cairo Airport and before completing your other travel procedures. You must wear a hazmat suit, the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it, and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the Kasr Al-Aini area in Cairo at a cheap price. You must wear a face mask during the whole flight. The company does not provide food and drink service during the flight. Upon boarding the plane, you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water. You must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom, as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it. In general, the flight from Cairo to Chengdu was quiet and comfortable.",2
"I found a room in Roger Smith hotel which is located on Lexington Avenue and about 47/48 St for just about $160 on hotels.com. For this price and for this location, it's an amazing deal! It's extremely rare that you'll find a room right in the midtown area for such a low price. The room wasn't small either. We booked a 2 queen beds room and we could walk comfortably without running into things. I also like the fact that there were two computers in the lobby for us guests to use. The bathroom was also pretty big for NYC standard. Though, there was one thing about my bed. It made noise when I twist and turn. I'm sure this doesn't happen to every room. Bottom line is, if you see a good deal at Roger Smith, go for it! Don't doubt that it's going to be bad just becuase it's cheap. It will worth the price!",2

I've been coming here on and off for a few years now",2
"I was hooked from the very first page. I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening. Isn't that the point of a good read? I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period. The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to ""show"" him. I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much.",2
The food is surprisingly delicious. 4 dishes are big enough to serve 5 pax! They gave free ice cream as well😇thumbs up for Haroo Haroo!!!!,2
"""House of Games"" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's. It is truly a must-see.",2

"Room Mate Grace has an awesome location in Times Square. The front desk crew is very helpful and really worked to get us an awesome place in the Village for dinner upon our late friday night arrival. The only bummer is that the owner held private parties both friday and saturday night so we could not use the bar and there was no DJ there either. Upon checkout they did apologize and say that this was unusual. The breakfast is quite tasty. Our room had lots of windows and good views. Loved the walk in shower too. The bed was comfy, however they need to put in a towel bar though in the bathroom. And, the plasma TV was nice but small. Loved the euro feel and vibe incl. the 'funky wall paper' on the 10th floor. Anyway, we will be back again! I like the newsstand at the checkin too. Oh, and the bag check on the last day was very helpful so we could completely enjoy the city for the day. Solid place to stay especially if you are a fan of modern living.",2
"Fast, efficient service at a good price",2
"The zen-like atmosphere was very relaxing and the location absolutely perfect! Right across the street from the busy marketplace, where you can find anything and everything to eat or drink. Also convenient to the Sausalito ferry. Be sure to take in the market on Tuesdays or Saturdays when local farms bring in their items.
The hotel staff was all very professional and helpful. Everyone wore a smile. The hotel bar and restaurant was really busy on Friday night with a major singles scene. The rest of our stay the hotel bar (Americana) was more subdued and more pleasant. Try their pomagranate martini--it was fantastic!!! They have a great outdoor patio with heat lamps for those cool evenings. We ate only one breakfast in the hotel restaurant but it was quite good and well presented.
I had one of the best massages I've ever had in the spa. I'm pretty picky when it comes to massages and somewhat leary of hotel spas but this one was unbelievable! Very clean and very professional. They also advertise soaking tubs but we never had a chance to try them. You might want to check those out.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for those that like to get away from the very large, very corporate-type hotels and prefer a more ""boutique"" style hotel.
PS. The rooms are small and our view from the 3rd floor was disappointing but I'm sure you can ask for a larger, better view.",2
"Favorite dishes: Sweet potato ravioli, baked goat cheese, and bistro salad ( they retired this recently, but hoping they bring it back). The usual is good and so is the filet. Love the cozy booths and friendly staff. Favorite spot in charlotte!",2
"Wir waren für vier Nächte im Redwood Inn. Das Hotel ist gut gelegen, man erreicht verschiedene Attraktionen zu Fuss, ebenfalls hat man in nächster Nähe verschiedene Bus-Stops. Dazu ist bestens ein MUNI-Passport (z.B. 3 Tage / $21.-) geeignet, womit man alle öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel benutzen kann.
Wir sind mit dem Mietfahrzeug angereist, welches wir gratis beim Hotel parkieren konnten. Das Zimmer und Bad war sauber und wurde auch täglich wieder auf vordermann gebracht.
Da das Hotel an der Lombard Street liegt, hört man natürlich den Lärm in den schlecht isolierten Zimmern. Aber wir empfanden den Lärm für erträglich.
Wir können dieses Hotel nur wärmstens empfehlen, Preis/Leistung stimmt voll und ganz.",2

I would highly recommend Las Vegas Window Tinting",2

The girl doing the sampling really wants people to try and like what they are sampling. Very friendly staff. There are items that TJs and Walmart don't have so I shop all 3 as needed but F and E is a twice a week place for me to go in quick, grab fresh salad food and fruit and get out.

"We stayed at the Palace this past weekend and it was a wonderful experience. We booked a package that included breakfast. We ordered our breakfast in our room every morning and it always arrived on time and was good. The food and drinks are extremely expensive at the Palace. I was glad we had a package including breakfast, otherwise 2 breakfasts would have cost over $100. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and very, very nice. They have a well trained staff. The hotel is in a wonderful location. Our room was nicely decorated and had a big flat screen tv (probably 42 inches). The beds were very comfortable.
We also ate dinner at Gilt one night (the hotel's restaurant). It was very good. They were able to fit us in at the last minute, and still got us out in time for our play.
I was exceptionally happy with our stay at the Palace and will definitely go back in the future.",2

"Best Hamburgers on the west coast. Usually a long line, but its well worth the wait. This family owed restaurant is opening new locations throughout the southwest. From Baldwin Park CA, they are now in Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. If you live west of the Mississippi they might be opening or opened one in your neck of the woods. Hamburgers are made with the freshest ingredients and are made to order. Beware of the hidden menu it becomes addicting. I like the fries extra crispy. The Milk shakes bring a happy ending to a wonderful meal. If you are heading through the drive thru and they have a double order lane, pay extra attention who is ahead of you. Usually the business guy is ordering for more than one. The same with the pick up truck guy, he might be getting the entire work crew an order. This is not the lane you want to pick. Instead opt for the guy in the sedan all bye himself usually single or with a friend type cars are the best option because they know what they want and will get through a lot quicker. Good luck and the best part is you can write a review while you wait for your meal like I am right now! Cheers!",2

"The hotel is only 2 years old and the architect and decorators did an amazing job. Each room has a modern but very comfortable feel to it. Each floor has it's own complimentary chilled water and bottle station. The lobby is designed to basically check in and then head up to your room. The second floor has the lounge.
The location was perfect, right across from the Rockefeller Center. on one end of the street it is 5th Avenue and the other end is Radio City Music Hall. You can step out of your hotel and walk to anything. If you turn right a walk a few blocks you are on Broadway. Shopping is all around you. Anthropolgie, J Crew, Zara, etc.
Their sister hotel, Club Quarters is 3 doors down with the restaurant The Terrace. Great place to eat while over looking the area. You can get room service from here.

"In the Belarus of 1942, two Soviet soldiers are captured by Nazi-friendly Belarusians. In captivity, the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly. One of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history. The cinematography, by Vladimir Chuchnov, is incredible - particularly in the opening sequence, where long, slow, tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural Belarus set the mood perfectly. It is easy to draw comparison to Tarkovsky's films, even more so since Tarkovsky's alter ego Anatoli Solonitsyn has a small but important part in The Ascent. The acting is overall brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the part of Sotnikov. The film reveals an old-fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion, which feels related to characters such as Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin, or Tarkovsky's Stalker. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but rather one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest, and human, that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated; the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think. The slow development of the characters, and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other, are somewhat reminiscent of The Commissar, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second watching, as well as a third, and a tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images, and emotional complexity.",2

The horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training.I will buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family film and I recommend it highly.A good ''Family Nite'' movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary.The native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down Brady.A hauntingly beautiful film.",2

We went on a Sunday evening, didn't have to wait for a table and the place was busy. Our waiter Bradley was great!\n\n+ We ordered Truffle fries to start. Super tasty! They went fast!! We tried 2 different pizzas: Margherita Napoletana style & Sam Giancana Chicago style. Both we very tasty and cooked perfectly! \n\n- The only area which I could recommend improvement would be to try and have the pizzas come to the table at the same time. It was almost a 10 minute difference between the 2 pizzas. \n\nWe are looking forward to returning to try new favorites.",2
"Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty. He hits on all cylinders, but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the FBI agent (Powers Booth) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller. Other than that, this movie was just fine.Bill Paxton plays Dad. He's never given a first name, but that is not a weakness of the film. It in fact strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind. He has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks(Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) must fine the demons and kill them. The demons look like normal people which they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if Dad has just lost his mind, or is he really doing god's work. There are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense.The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and is speaking with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and rightfully so. After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leads and Paxton work great together, looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. Like I said there is the one implausibility involving Powers Booth's character, but it really isn't a big thing. This was an extremely well made film involving faith and family.",2
Food was great service was great people very friendly nex time i retun to LA with family it will be on my list of hotels to return.,2
Fresh ingredients and generous portion.,2
i feel very content and settled down,2
"Very positive experience. Order was easy, customer service when needed was helpful and it was a lot cheaper than going through phone networks directly. Would recommend",2
"Quality tools , for the home mechanic or professional
Great product, superior quality. Excellent addition to my toolbox.",2
"Everything about this place is just yes! The food, the beer, the atmosphere, and friendly service. This is the kind of place we live for. Not to mention, kid friendly for our tot to come along. Will be back!",2
A very professional outfit. Kept fully informed when flight from Gatwick diverted to Grenoble as a result of security alert at Chambery. Both flights with Titan Airways smooth and uneventful with excellent landings. A welcome change to have pleasant and obliging service from cabin crew and informative announcements from the flight deck.,2
"Lisbon to Torino. The flight was delayed 20 minutes, but the ground staff kept us informed of updates. The seats were OK, and sandwiches / drinks provided were good. What made this trip awesome was the cabin staff service. One staff even made some coffee just for my family when we asked for some. If other staff are half as good, the human touch will easily make up for other, sometimes systemic, low cost carrier shortcomings.",2
Very happy with all my purchases I did buy a child's item before Christmas and it was damaged didn't send it back it was for Christmas.but happy with everything else.,2
"I have loved the Landmark for years and hadn't been here in awhile. It's still great. We had the salad bar, which is a salad room with everything under the sun available.\n\nWhat I like about this restaurant is a trip to the basement where there is a fabulous collection of photos recounting Arizona's history. This is a good place for lovers of history.",2
"Based on breakfast/brunch:\n\nWHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO EAT HERE?!\n\nWhen it comes to buffets, it's mostly misses to me. Other than the Wynn buffet, no other buffet has made me take more than 2 trips (2 plates) for food. But this evil little place had me up and about 4 friggin times! Now granted I didn't eat everything that I took back to my table. I just mainly sampled and put it aside if it wasn't to my liking. Once again, if you have a problem with that, read my review for the Wynn Buffet and then you can shut up about it. \n\nAnyways... they don't have a huge selection of food, but the food they do offer is scrumptious and the presentation is seriously unrivaled. Foods have their own little container/pot/serving. I'm assuming for aesthetics, but it's also great for me cause there's some kind of portion control. Instead of grabbing two ladles of mac&cheese, you just grab a mini sized pot of it. Very smart, Wicked Spoon. Very smart. \n\nMy favorite part was their Nutella gelato. If you follow my reviews, y'already know how much I cry for Nutella. So please believe I had two cups of that chocolatey nutty goodness. *drool*\n\nIt's weirdly decorated. Well it's supposed to look \""wicked.\"" They definitely accomplished that. Everything was set off with an orange backdrop of light. Tis a plus in my books seeing how I'm from the bay and my boys, SF GIANTS, just won the WS so bonus mothaeffin points. \n\nPs. I believe you are entitled to a free mimosa. Free drank? Yes, please. \n\nTIP: If buffet's aren't really your thing, they do have a to-go option here. I believe it's about $16 and they give you a fatty ass container and a free bottled water, you stuff as much food as you can in the box, and go on your merry way. I haven't done it myself, but my friends have and they seemed quite pleased (and full). \n\nI will most definitely come back for lunch or dinner. Can't wait to get fat.",2
Highly recommend. They offer free wifi which is unheard of at a Westin level property. Staff is super helpful.,2
"We loved our stay at the Iroquois. The staff is very helpful and friendly...giving great recommendations for restaurants and how to get around. We booked through a 3rd party, who did not notify the hotel that there would be 2 people staying in our room. The front desk offered an upgrade to a larger room, without us having to ask. Bill was really helpful, he gave us great suggestions for dinner, took care of our luggage and secured us a car for our trip to the airport while we did our last minute shopping. The hotel is clean, friendly, nicely decorated and in a great location. We'd definitely stay here again.",2
"We chose the Mondrian SoHo based on it's location and our familiarity with other Morgans Hotel Group properties such as The Delano hotel in South Beach...we were not disappointed. From AJ meeting us curbside to take our bags and direct us to the hotel lobby (not on the main level of the hotel), to being presented a room well before the standard check in time, our stay got off to a great start. The hotel is located steps away from trains headed in almost every direction, which made it easy for us to get out to a Yankee game, downtown to Times Square, up to Central Park and everything in between. The staff at the desk were incredibly helpful in suggesting things to do and places to go and when we ran into AJ on our second day at the hotel he was able to provide us with some history of the area which inspired us to spend time exploring a little more of SoHo during the day and well into the night. The onsite restaurant (Imperial No. Nine) has a spectacular garden room, that keeps you protected from the elements while feeling as though you're sitting outdoors. We sat at the bar a few times throughout our stay and the service was prompt, courteous and professional...we shared many laughs with the bartenders, who indulged every question and made suggestions on drinks that we might like...the Lemon Drop Martini was great! The rooms may seem small to some, but were in line with our size expectations in the city and they're so well appointed that size becomes even less of an issue. Housekeeping did an excellent job in our room and didn't create a disturbance in the hallways early in the morning, which was truly appreciated. On the topic of noise, I've read a few reviews that complained of the hotel being very noisy, this was not at all our experience, there is a night club at the hotel but we never heard a thing...perhaps this is based on room location in proximity to the club? The view from our room , was not the Empire State Building but still offered a look across rooftops into the city and showed some great colour in the sky as night fell. On our day of departure, we had a lot of last minute things planned, the bellman took care of our bags and even offered us an umbrella to take on our adventures since it was pouring rain...when we returned, the bellman had our bags for us quickly, hailed us a taxi and wished us safe travels home. From start to finish we encountered nothing but fantastic service from every member of the Mondrian Soho team...we're returning this summer to celebrate our 15 year anniversary!",2
Nice ambience. Fast service. Good food with reasonable price.,2
Really good for all your favorites but Spotify's suggestions have really widened my listening range. Both thumbs up.,2

"""Dô desu ka den"" is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly is not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where the dwellers are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors, but indeed they are very sad stories, some of them heart-breaking. I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Dodeskaden  O Caminho da Vida"" (""Dodeskaden  The Way of the Life"")",2

"The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced. Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.",2
"It was wonderful. I mean, they had good food and entertainment for the people. They even provided pillows and eye masks and headphones, and I slept nicely.",2
"Upon my return to Olives, I had one of the most romantic and wonderful experiences ever in Las Vegas. The food was exceptional, the service was out standing. But what took my breath away is sitting outside next to the fountains at night during a full summer moon. I felt like we weren't in Las Vegas, between the cuisine, wine and service. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back upon my next visit to Las Vegas!",2

Great SOP in place for dining in. Especially love the Chicken Limau Perut (spicy) 😋Smaller portion suitable for 2-3 pax sharing and more reason to order more!,2
"Situated on corner of busy Jonker Street, means a great place to watch people coming and going from this busy, vibrant area. We ordered drinks, before 8pm there are buy 3 for 2 offers which we took advantage of on two nights. Food is served and looked ok for pub grub but we didn’t eat here so can’t comment on food. Resident musicians on both nights was a nice surprise too.",2
"Twitter is a good, one of the best, platforms for staying current with thing's you are interested in or need/want to know.

"Very Nice Item
Gorgeous items. Fast shipping, easy payment & very good quality. LS",2
Fantastic backup for a faulty battery emailed with details and a replacement battery was received the very next day fantastic service,2
The location is wonderful and allows you to walk to the mall. The rooms are large and well appointed. The beds are very comfortable. Ask for a room that does not face the back of the hotel.......you will view the air conditioning units and another building. The rooms are on this side are also dark. Opt for a room that faces the front of the hotel or the side (away from the White House). The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and a pleasure to sit with friends and relax a bit. The service was excellent and I would love to stay here again.,2
"Lindsay Bell has sworn off men; she's been used enough, thank you very much. She's determined to focus on the interior decorating company she runs with her two best friends, Anna and Candace. But their newest assignment, turning an old Victorian home into an inn for lovers, is about to turn Lindsay's celibate world upside down. With an unlimited budget and an assignment to design a room any way she wants, Lindsay plans on creating a BDSM fantasy suite. But to do that she needs a wall taken down, and that brings sexy handyman Brad Caldwell to her door. Will being in close quarters with an intelligent, hardworking, drop-dead gorgeous man be enough to make Lindsay give up her vow and take a chance on love?A touch of magic adds spice to this delicious fantasy tale by Cathryn Fox. All Tied Up is a red-hot start to what is sure to be a wonderful series. What's wonderful about both Lindsay and Brad is that neither is all that they appear to be on the surface. It was lovely to watch them uncover each other's layers the more time they spent with one another, both in bed and out. Both Lindsay and Brad are incredibly likeable, making me root for their finding happiness with one another.All Tied Up is the first book in Ms. Fox's Pleasure Inn series and I finished the story incredibly eager for Anna and Candace's books.

"I love, love, love this company. I previously raved about my first experience ever in Chicago. For some reason, I have acquired two yelp accounts and cannot access the the other one. Anyway, bringing it back. \n\nI had the best experience in Chicago. The employees were amazing and so helpful. So I was thrilled to find one in fashion show last year. Now I'm totally bummed they closed!! I walked into the store at fashion show and was immediately greeted by Amber and she gave me the same great customer service that I experienced in Chicago. She took care of my order and shipped it to me, for free mind you, to Hawaii!!! Of course I had to spend at least $100 but for the amount of products you get it is totally worth it. Can I just add that those things are heavy and Victoria's Secret never has free shipping to hawaii and their stuff is way way lighter. Brandy Melville also had crazy shipping fees to hawaii. And a lot of places don't even ship here either. So considering all theses things you can understand why I was so stoked. \n\nShe personally calls me to let me know when there's going to be a sale so I can preorder. She would also check up on me if I needed refills of anything. So when I got the call from Amber that the store was closing, the mix of emotions went from wait, 70% off everything to wait, where am I going to go now? \n\nI have yet to visit this location but I can only expect the same great customer care and look forward to visiting soon.",2

"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was very convienent for the purpose of our trip (football game)> The only problem we experienced was in the breakfast area. The hostess was not helpful and a bit rude. She acted as if we were a nuisance.. ( So sorry you actually have a paying job in this economy; my husband has been out of work since June 30!) Everyone else could not have been nicer and she was the only ""thorn"" in the whole trip.",2
"Having stayed in a very average New York hotel for several nights it was a relief to arrive at the Mayflower and spread out in an incredibly spacious and beautifully appointed room. I stayed on the 8th floor which provided access to the Executive Lounge - this is an excellent option as you can avail yourself of breakfast and relax in some very nice surrounds and access free WiFi. The Manager of the Lounge was particularly helpful and very pleasant. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom amenities were of high quality and the service efficient and unobtrusive. Dupont Circle is just up the road so there are plenty of restaurants nearby and the location allows you to take a very pleasant 45 minute walk in the morning past the White House and around the Washington Memorial.
The only slight negative was the actual size of the hotel. Be ready to put on your trainers as it is quite a trek from one side to the other.",2

Das Hotel ist absolut perfekt gelegen. Braucht aber dringend eine Überholung. Alles ist etwas dunkel und sieht zum Teil nicht sehr zuvorkommend aus. Die Zimmer waren aber sauber.

The return trip via Singapore left Singapore morning to Sydney with about a 1 hour stopover then to Canberra arriving about 2030.

"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tech Center on a fun trip with my son recently. It was a perfectly good hotel for our purposes and I would recommend it to anyone and would happily stay there again on another trip to Denver, despite having a few issues with the property.
The hotel was nice and clean and in a good location if you do not have to go downtown. Traffic was relatively light in the area (we were there over a holiday weekend; since this is primarily a business district, I imagine it is busier during the week) and there were plenty of restaurants within driving distance. The Tech Center area is a pleasant business park area that is well-maintained and clean. The hotel had a decent (but pricey) breakfast and a nice indoor pool and hot tub (very clean and well-kept). The bed was very comfortable.
There were a few downsides during our trip. First, the walls seemed to be somewhat thin as there was a group of spanish-speaking people that were up late talking loudly one night and I could hear everything they said (but not understand it!). I almost called the front desk, but they finally quieted down about 11:30 p.m.
Also, the staff failed to clean our room one day. We left the room about 10:30 a.m., and did not come back until 6:30 p.m., so they had plenty of time and there was not a sign on the door telling them not to disturb. So, I was disappointed in that.
Finally, when I made my reservation with Hyatt, I bought an upgrade package that included breakfast, parking and internet. Before I bought it, I called Hyatt's customer service to make sure it would include breakfast for both me and my son. They told me that my son would be able to eat free, so it would not be a problem. But, when I arrived at the hotel, they told me that only kids under 5 eat free. My son is 10, so he was not free. When I politely explained the situation to the front desk personnel, and that I had been told something different by Hyatt customer service, they offered no apology or even a token gesture to make up for it. In my opinion, a top-notch property tries to at least offer a token gesture. Especially since I am a Hyatt Gold Club member. But, nope, nothing from them for this misinformation.
But, those negatives aside, the property itself is nice and the staff were generally courteous, so I would recommend it.",2

"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a bachelorette party about 3 weeks ago. The hotel is in a wonderful location. The river walk runs through the hotel. It is within walking distance to several restaurants as well as some bars and shopping! Our room was very clean and we had great customer service. One of the girls I was staying with bought some milk and other items she wanted to keep cold and she called to the front desk and the delivered a mini fridge within in 5 minutes. We also had someone trip and hit there head,which started to bleed. We had the on-staff medics come and check on her to make sure she was alright. They called us two more times, and came back up to the room to make sure that she was doing ok. They have a very caring and hard working staff. I highly recommend staying at this hotel is you plan to visit San Antonio and want to stay on the river walk. I would defiantly come back.",2

"Basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do, rather than having to sit through it for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a kult hit, one of those movies wherein the humour, the plot, the acting, is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it, trusting the director well, the reward is: U laugh your A.. of !! The fact that U have to find the things mentioned above, actually makes the movie even more funny, because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is, which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : Spaced Invaders !!",2

"The only thing better than the hotel and it's downtown/riverwalk location was the staff. From the first moment you enter the premises you are greeted warmly and made to feel valued. The food and service at Zocca's, the in-house restaurant were.great. It's location makes it an easy walk to some of the best restaurants, shopping and sights of the city. We spent three nights there and the only complaint was the timing of their washing of the driveway. We needed to leave the hotel at 10:30 a.m. and, being handicapped, it was very difficult to negotiate a stairway to get to our valet delivered car at the bottom of 8 steps rather than directly from the lobby. I will definitely consider the Westin Riverwalk for future trips to San Antonio.",2

"JFC this place is good. Pizzas are top notch. I like the big sexy personally, spicy and delicious.

"En voyage de noce en juin 2011 : hotel trouvé sur expedia dans formule voyage compris.
Hôtel situé à Chinatown, parfait à côté de 2 stations de métro, à proximité de little italy, pas loin du centre de manathan en métro et tout à proximité à savoir resto, pharmacie, ....
Hôtel propre (mais les draps non changés tous les jours : petit bémol donc), bien insonorisé, literie nickel, douche fonctionnelle, produits de toilette et serviettes quotidiens, accueil nickel.
Petit déj compris est parfait mais salle un peu petite du coup il faut se lever tôt pour avoir de la place.
N'hésitez pas courrez y (PS : le quartier même si pas très calme ne craint absolument pas)",2

"My wife and I just returned from our first trip to New York City, The Hilton Times Square was great! The location right in the middle of Times Square was perfect. Subway Station was on the same block and there were plenty of restaurants nearby. Room prices and food in the hotel is pricey, but what isn't in New York! Nothing outstanding about the rooms, but location is the selling factor for staying here.",2

"Perfect last meal of 2014! \n\nIf you are an avid Jose Andres fan or Meat lover, this is your food heaven. \n\nYou just know that dinner experience will be awesome when you are greeted by an enthusiastic server. \n\nOur awesome waiter, Chris kindly walked us through the menu and we decided on the NYE prefix menu with A La cart. \n\nBazaar has more or less traditional signature dish of jose with speciality on meat. \n\nChef's selected cured meat was delicious but little too much for two people. ( Definitely suggested with group of 4+) \n\nI had to go for the cotton candy foie gras granted its banned in California for a good reason. I felt like a terrible human being trying it but decided not to think about it... #FOMO #YOLO.\n\nThe prefix meal was pretty incredible. I suggest the restaurant to reduce the serving portion and dropping the price a little to make it more available to wider audience. Vegas is really foodie heaven, especially to those who don't drink like myself.\n\nWe had the honor to try out their A8 Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef. It literally melts in your mouth and is worth every bite. \n\nThere's less ridiculous props involved in this particular restaurant, but enough to make the experience triply bazaar and unique. It's worth deviating little further from the strip for the experience.",2
I recently visited Montreal last week (Oct7-11) Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal which is next to Eggspectation. I ate there at least once a day! Great food and service! Even the manager waits tables and is very frendly. Best French toast ever!,2
"ZRH-CUN-ZRH. The onward Economy flight was just great. Seats were a bit worn but comfy. The Inflight Entertainment consists only of some audio channels. No individual screens so no individual movies no games just two movies on the big screens - unsatisfactory. But the food was great a tasty main dish and lots of ice cream and sandwiches during the flight. Also the crew was friendly and efficient. I consider the inflight economy product on Edelweiss apart from the in-flight entertainment better than the Swiss economy on long haul. But definitely not so the ""Relax"" Class on the return flight which is also sold by Swiss as Business Class. We decided to do so because the flight back was a night flight and we wanted to sleep - it's a complete waste of money. There was separate and fast check-in at Cancun but we had the same latest check-in time than economy what a joke. When we asked for the lounge we were told that there wasn't any for Edelweiss Passengers. That definitely was not a joke. Once aboard the seats looked like old economy seats some 30 years ago. Small ridiculous seat pitch of not even 39 inch that's just 7 inch more than on economy. It was a bit reclinable but probably not more than 45°. I could not stretch my legs and it was impossible to sleep. There were only few newspapers and 2 low-quality gossip magazines. What was not a good alternative to the 6 movies offered in the media player distributed at the beginning of the flight. The only highlight was the food and the drinks offered they were very good. And again the crew were friendly and nice although a bit slow - the first course was served 90 minutes after take-off. But on my opinion not only the passengers but also the crew deserves a better product than this so called ""relax"" class probably they feel very embarrassed to work in such an ambiance. Swiss should be ashamed to sell something like this as Business Class.",2

"Das Hotel liegt im Südosten von Jacksonville in einem Gewerbegebiet und ist gut über den Highway zu erreichen. Es liegt in einer Hotelzone neben zahlreichen anderen Hotels, die alle sehr stark frequentiert waren. In der Nähe gibt es zahlreiche Fastfood-Restaurants, Diner, ein großer Wal Mart sowie mehrere Shopping Malls (Vor allem Town Center ist sehr zu empfehlen). Bis nach Downtown Jacksonville benötigt man ca. 15 Minuten mit dem Auto, bis zum Flughafen weitere 15 Minuten. Das sehr schöne Jacksonville Beach mit einem tollen, breiten Sandstrand ist in ca. 20 Minuten über den gut ausgebauten Butler Blvd zu erreichen und sehr zu empfehlen!
Das Hotel an sich ist ein typisches Best Western Hotel, zahlreiche kostenlose Parkplätze vor der Tür, Swimming Pool im Hinterhof sowie kostenloses Frühstück. Das Hotel macht von aussen einen gepflegten Eindruck, unser Zimmer jedoch war eher alt und abgewohnt. Die Größe war ok, der Komfort des Bettes auch, aber die Einrichtung war schon einige Jahre alt und das ganze Zimmer sehr renovierungsbedürftig. Sauberkeit ok, aber ein rechter Wohlfühleffekt wollte nicht aufkommen. Kurz: Für ein paar Tage durchaus empfehlenswert, vor allem aufgrund der sehr guten Lage und des top Preises!",2

"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights recently, and was purchased through Hotwire.
First the good:
The room was a great size, great a/c, bathroom clean and a nice size, great sized window, free wifi and a lot of TV channels to choose from. Free shuttle from the airport as well. Extremely quiet even with airplanes landing right by the window. Overall great.
The bad:
You have to pay for parking, they charge $15 a day PLUS tax, instead of just leaving it $15 a day, it goes up to $16.50, and the entire time I was there the parking was almost always empty, so its not like the hotel was struggling with parking space. Secondly the TV system in this hotel was atrocious, I sometimes had to turn the TV on and off 4 or 5 times before I finally was able to start changing channels, Also there is TV listing sheet in the room so to get the specific channel names was a process with the on screen menu.
I would definitely recommend this hotel but mainly for those people who have to catch an early flight one day, but if you're there to visit the city, stay a bit closer, the traffic is BAAAAD.",2
"i have used this company on many occasion and not rated them.\non every visit which included purchase as well as 2 repair requests, i have received the best greeting...and also the best repair service. they made sure we were given progress reports for service as well as cost and time.\nthese are great folks with which to do business.",2

Love that it's not glass. It is truly full coverage for the edges which is what I needed with my case. However, the privacy tint could be better. It's a gray tint instead of full black. Just keep the phone brightness down to a minimum. Even at full brightness, the tint fizzes at the angle but again, fully black tints would give the privacy i desire. Hope for more options or improvement in the future.",2

"We saw Vovomeena was listed as the best breakfast in the neighborhood by the New Times so figured we'd give it a Sunday morning go. What a great place! It's hidden behind the Five Guys in that center so we'd never even seen it before. We were fortunate that it was not as busy as some other Yelpers have experienced and,showing up during a lull, the coffee bar guy even came over and discussed the menu with us. \n\nGreat service, great food, love the atmosphere and coffee. And all just an easy bike ride down 5th Ave. Sinfully delicious but a worthwhile breakfast bookmark.",2

Okay, the situations are not always original, has minor plot holes and it has a tendency to be too clever some (brief) times for its own sake, but it actually delivers and is obviously a work of love. I'd be curious to know what the budget was. AND. for once, this is not a cheap Tarantino copy ! (Well, film noir didn't started with Tarantino, you know.) Will it once again be saved by Europe, like John Dahl's movies were, so Mr Guttierez can make another one like this ? If you ever read this, Mr Guttierez, thank you and se",2

I wolfed it down so fast I didn't realize I had no left overs for my husband to take home. We were having such a great time and a nice couple on the next table decided to buy our wine bottles. That was a really sweet gesture. I can't wait to come back. Actually, I am going to check out their new restaurant on Tatum and Bell. Our server mentioned it opened a couple of days ago. That branch is closer to us and I was told Toni, the guy at the oven making the pizzas will be there.",2

"Hotel is a ten min walk to Time Square and Port Authortity Bus Terminal which has a subway stop for getting aroung town.
Staff are friendly and willing to help or let you get on with checking in and out if you know what your doing. We were greeted and wished well by lobby crew each time we entered and exited the hotel and also got help hailing a cab in the pooring rain with crew member opening his umberella for us to stop us getting wet while getting into cab. Excellent!
Room is clean and modern looking as is the whole hotel and was cleaned by maid service daily to a good standard. TV in room has loads of channels to flick through, the bed is interesting being electric and moveable but importantly it is comfortable and when moved out into room does not completely block walk way.
Bathroom area is good and clean and although can seem odd with no door to shut out from rest of room does have a curtain to slide accross for bit of privacy if wanted.
Would advice you ask about up coming events in hotel or use the free computers with internet access in the mission control area which will have this info as there can be some good stuff going on in the evenings here.
Did not try and food here so can not comment on that but overall very pleased with our stay here and would recommend it as a good clean comfortable base with good helpful staff to use while you go off and explore New York.",2

"I seriously don't get why this restaurant doesn't have more stars. This is easily one of the best Mexican food I've ever had. This place is soooo good! \n\nThe ambience was perfect and decor was lovely as expected since it's in the Venetian. I thought it was gonna be just your average Mexican restaurant but it was so much more than that! \n\nI had the cheese enchiladas with cilantro rice and I can't even begin to say how delicious it was! It was too perfect for words. \n\nI've had cilantro rice at a few other restaurants after that but it's nothing compared to this place! The portions are big enough to where you can have leftovers to savor for a late night snack! \n\nA little pricy, I'll admit but well worth it! To this day I'm still raving about my amazing dining experience at this place! I'm definitely coming back the next time in Vegas!",2

"Though we only live two hours away, last Saturday night was our first visit to the property and we've already decided to book a room again for next weekend.
The recent renovations transformed the property and the guestrooms were as spacious as they are beautiful. We had dinner downstairs at Elways and the steak was unparalled.
The room rate was surprisinglyreasonable and was absolutely worth every penny.
As always, the staff was top notch rounding out a wonderful overall experience.",2

"We stayed for 4 nights at the start of our honeymoon and it was the perfect choice. The staff, surroundings, facilities and location allowed us to relax and get on with the enjoyable task of exploring San Fran.
We took advantage of Keith and Jackie's advice from the concierge desk and pretty much shaped our stay around their recommendations. Restaurants, baseball tickets, ferry trips away from the tourists etc all turned out to be perfect. Keith even gave us loads of great recommendations for our 4 nights in Napa.
Internet access with printing was handy, views of the Bay Bridge stunning, comfortable bed and massive bathroom.... All top notch. Only downer was not having a bath - but hey, you can't have it all! The chaps on the bell desk were utterly helpful and took all the stress out of taxis, parking hire car and so on. Bar and restaurant were lively and the breakie was delicious. Really -don't book anywhere else.",2

"Personally, I disdain The Jerry Springer Show, however, I found ""Ringmaster"" to be the funniest movie I've seen this year. The never-ending satire of Jerry Springer ""guests"" starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value.",2
"We stayed three nights at the Whitehall Hotel through Priceline. We got a very good rate of 75 dollars, but we were charged an additional 20 dollars for an extra bed. While we know that through Priceline we are only guaranteed one bed, this is the first time ever we had to have an additional charge. Usually a rollway is provided. Our first night we encountered an unhappy employee named April. We had an engineer come twice to our room: tv and phone issues. Internet required many calls because the code would be wrong. I addressed these issues with an email to the hotel. Immediately I was contacted by managers. This was impressive. Actually two managers contacted me and wanted to remedy what I had complained about. We even got a call at our home when we got back. They were very attentive. I just thanked them for contacting me. We did not receive any compensation. That was fine.
The concierge William was wonderful. He got us half price tickets to a comedy club, and he helped us find restaurants. He was very helpful.
The ice is a hassle-having to order it from the phone. The elevator was fine, and our room on the 13th floor had a nice view.
The coffee is not ready before 7:00a.m. and bring a mug with you to carry to your room.
The ambience is quaint. OVerall, very nice.",2
Reduce sweetness in cooking. Top quality and best price,2
"After reading the reviews, we expected huge crowds and little food at the breakfast buffets and long waits for the elevator (we were on the 15th floor). NOT! This is a great place to stay if you want convenience, a friendly and helpful staff, plentiful breakfast, and a free ""dinner meal"" on Tuesdays/Wednesdays. We entered NYC on the train from Newark's airport at Penn Station and walked 6 blocks to the hotel. When we left, we simply crossed the street and caught the express bus ($16 each) back to the airport. Our room had a kingsize bed and all the amenities of a new hotel, compactly put together. For anyone who needs a view, you would want to request one of the higher floors (32 floors). We spent very little time there, so the view meant zilch to us. There are 3 hotels in a row, Sheraton and Marriott Fairfield Inn. The street might look a little sketchy, but for me every side street in New York has its secrets.",2
"There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years. The Gospel road was one of them. I watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite parts were the fact that 1/Jesus was blond, 2/the last supper was a huge meal,3/ he liked playing with the children,4/His death was for all people and for all time.The movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting, but it touched my heart at that time. Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture. If it ever comes out on DVD, I will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons.",2
"Sexed into Love (Easy Read)
This was a very ""engaging"" read. Although there's no mystery about the eventual ""union"" between Abigail and Sir Nicholas, their ""rides"" along the way were very entertaining. The book was an easy read with lots of ""hot action"" to keep the reader anticipating the next rendezvous. The blunt ending was the book's only downside. In my opinion, a HEA is reflected best when there's a wedding between the main couple or couples.",2

"Good video resolution at proper distances
I bought this camera to try to inspect a bathtub drain. The image was crisp and clear until it got into standing water. Even with the LEDs at full brightness, it still will not penetrate even clean water enough to give you a clear picture of what is in there. I also suspect that since the camera was starting into the trap, that the length of the camera head could not make the bend and was too close to the sidewall of the trap to get a clear image. However, for $40, this is an excellent camera. I can think of many other great uses for it where it would perform spectacularly.",2
"Thank you for cleaning up your act insomniac! Last year I was a bit disappointed on many different levels with the way edc turned out.. This year was a different story.\n\nFirst off... Production was amazing this year! Amazing artwork, stages were over the top (they had a gigantic owl at the main stage that was trippin me out), and the lighting just made me feel like I was on a different planet. It was all an orgasm for the human eye. \n\nMusic was well rounded this year. Although I love my trance and was sad about there not being an ASOT stage like last year, I was not at all disappointed with the DJs that were brought in. Of course not everyone is going to be pleased by the line ups for one reason or another, but it really did seem like insomniac tried to cater towards many interests and not just one. Bottom line... I think all attendees found at least one stage/DJ they enjoyed.\n\nFree water refill stations are always a great addition, and it helped to have chill and upbeat volunteers for working them. Plenty of bathrooms for people. Even with the thousands and thousands of people there, the wait never exceeded 5 minutes. \n\nOverall, I say this was one of my favorite years attending edc. PLUR people, nice workers, and plenty of space to walk around. I loved the additional rides too! And now the waiting period beings for next year...",2
"The hotel is ideally situated within a 2 minute drive of some of Austin's best restaurants and bars. The rooms are beautifull and the bar is one the best hotel bars around.
However, the hotel staff is so rude it overshadows all of the good qualities of this 4 star hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel with a full car of luggage, the college kids the hotel considers its bell hops could have cared less about helping us with our bags despite three or four them standing arounding with nothing to do. Once we got to the room we were impressed with the rooms, albeit they are very small. After my fiance got out of the shower she realized the hotel staff mistakenly forgot to put towels in our room. A easily fixable mistake, which happens to the best of us. However, after a rude operator agreed to send towels to the room knowing she had justed finished a shower without a towel, they waited 20 minutes to finally deliver the towels. To cap off the trip, it took the hotel staff another 20 minutes to pull my car out of the valet lot. At 4 star hotel prices it should perform like one.",2

The hotel was beautiful. I stayed for business for 3 nights and 4 days. The rooms were well appointed and the bathroom was very nice. The rooms were cold and it took forever for it to warm up even with the thermostat at 75 degrees. I didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant but the room-service was good. The bar had seasonal drinks and provided us with a good place to chat and hash-out strategies in a lively environment. I would certainly stay here again.,2
Very good food at fair prices. The staff is very friendly and their 3 cheese Gordon Bleu is a great buy - highly recommended.,2

"The hotel is located directly across from the airport. Parking choices are Valet $24/day or Self-Park (uncovered and short distance) for $17/day...both can be charged to your room with in-n-out privileges.
We checked in very late - and our options were 2 beds in the ""main"" tower - or - a king (what we requested) in the other tower. We were tired - we took the 2 bed room in the main tower.
It worked out - our room had a balcony that overlooked a harbo where MANY boats are moored (sp?) It overlooked the outdoor pool and walking trail or sidewalk. It was a very nice view. I think we were in room 1034.
Our room had a connecting door to the next room - you could hear people loud and clear in the morning. I'm not sure if they were extra loud or the walls were paper thin (or the noises came through the clearance below the door).
The bed was SO comfortable - it is my 2nd favorite bed behind the ""Cloud 9"" Westin bed in Oklahoma City.
Bathroom was up to date and clean.
We didn't try internet access.
The magazines in the room were helpful - it even had a coupon for Harbor cruises that helped. The concierge (sp?) also has coupons and maps - stop by to see him/her.
We stopped by the bar for one drink - it seemed nice.
We didn't use any othe shop/cafe/restaurant in the main tower.
The ""other"" tower was just 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile down the road - I'm sure it would have been fine.
We did not use a taxi - but the concierge mentioned that it would cost @ $10 to go 4 miles (one way) over to the Marriott hotel (where our friends were) by the convention center. There are some parking meters near the tourist spots - they tend to run $.25 for 12 minutes - and there is a parking garage by the Nimitz aircraft carrier museum. Just thought I would toss that in in case you are trying to decide whether to rent a car or whether to take a taxi to your locations.
We would definitely stay here again. We felt like we got a good price for the type of accomodations we received.",2

For engineering student and CS students math is really basic and unchallenging. Most topics are explained conceptually and through many examples. Math shown here is just enough to explain what is really happening in the algorithm and what is behind all of it. I believe this is the best starting point for someone who is new to machine learning, and this course should give them enough knowledge to continue in their desired direction.Many thanks to fantastic professor Ng, who made this course a really enjoyable experience.",2

"I had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam.'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons. The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly aged men, come to relax and to go bathing. The father has to sons: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him. To this son the traditional village, the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying, but this changes along the movie.Though the story may sound cheesy or cliche, it's not. With really great performances, especially of the father and the 'retarded' son (sorry, I don't know their names) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time.If you got a chance to see this movie do it. It's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema.",2

"My 10 year old daughter and I stayed there for our first trip to NYC. The location of the hotel was excellent. We were able to walk almost everywhere. The staff was super friendly and helpful (especially in helping us with directions). The room was beautiful and superclean. The food was excellent. The breakfast that was delivered to our room each morning was excellent. The lobby and main public areas were beautifully decorated and the security was topnotch because we always felt safe there. If I ever go back to NYC, I would 100% stay there again and would recommend anyone I know to as well.",2
"The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But, I liked it. I found myself grinning through the entire movie. I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I pictured them. And the town and scenery were just right as well. I recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.",2
"Turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the mixture of turkey. it has mostly the same language but different dialects. this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. you can watch reportings with singers and groups, their performances , their daily life and learn their thoughts of music. the movie includes not only the music of Istanbul but the life in Istanbul , how people communicate and what they eat and drink. the surprising part is although i live in Istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie.",2

"Recently stayed at the Hilton back bay for a convention at the Hynes center. The hotel is convenient to the convention center, its across the street from it, and you can even cut through the Sheraton to make the trip even shorter.
The rooms were pretty standard large chain rooms, nothing really that distinctive or interesting. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling on one corner but the room itself felt clean and well kept. The internet costs $15 a day, which in this day and age feels expensive. Most hotels i stay at includes that as part of the stay. I mean realistically the internet doesnt really cost hotels much at all, I'm always annoyed when they use it as a reason to gouge you to cough up 20 bucks a day for it. The parking is $40 a day, and we ordered two beers from room service and after gratuity and 'administrative costs' it was $30.
In conclusion, the stay itself was fine, the bed was comfortable, the room was spacious and the view was good. I just didnt like the high price of the hidden costs like parking, internet and such. Its almost as if the 200 room rate is just a drop in the bucket of the other 60-70 you can expect to spend on top of that.
Average overall, I'd stay there if I had to or it was a business expense but i probably wouldnt make it my first choice if i went on leisure.",2

"Arguably this is a very good ""sequel"", better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! Cruella DeVil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that she has changed. Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball...Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! One downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film. This is also funnier than the last film.Enjoy ""102 Dalmatians""! :-)",2

"We just returned from a trip to CA and we stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 2 nights. I booked this hotel based on comments seen on Trip Advisor! This hotel is not luxurious but it is a great hotel in the best location!! The rooms are big, clean and modern and the bathrooms are huge with lots of counter space. The staff were friendlly and the Doorman was always helpful with his suggestions. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting San Fran!",2

In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps, (federated terran space, space vikings, even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading, great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!",2
I may be biased in my review because when we stayed here we were on the top floor. The room was absolutely wonderful and the room service was prompt and courteous. The bedroom was modern and the bathroom was spacious for two! \nThe living room had plenty of room or us to spread out and repack for the remainder of our voyages in the wild west! Off the strip for those that have been there and done that enough times. The balconies are not for those with a fear of heights... especially on a windy day! It is a great place for the experienced Las Vegas traveler!!!,2

Bought this as a hopeful alternative to my cats scratching the corner of a chair I have in the den. They choose this over the chair about half the time. They also like to sleep on it. As you might expect, some small shreds of cardboard are on the floor after they scratch it for a period of time. It also holds on to cat hair that they shed while they're playing on/around it, but it only takes a moment of my time to wipe it off. Might buy again when/if they ever destroy the one I have to the point where it needs to be replaced.",2

AWESOME workout room on the 24 floor overlooking the city...it's state of the art, roomy, and FREE!

"Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines: ""A ham, A ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!!"" The dramatic guy that tells Felix he'll ""have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies."" He's in tears. Felix just looks at him like he's nuts, and shrugs his shoulders. The old guy tells Felix to ""go ye forth"" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, ""How does he expect me to get the money?""In minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he spots a shoe business owner putting up a ""bankrupt"" sale on his store. Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works.Well, it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In an outrageous scene, Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to Hollywood, transforming himself back to cat when they get there.We then witness Felix's attempts at getting into show business. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives. In all, quite a bit of material is in this 9.5- minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length.At any rate, there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon, like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.",2

The location is terrific -- next to a lovely lake and a couple of blocks of small shops and restaurants. It is a short drive to a shopping mall and just about any of the nicer chain restaurants. The hotel's rooms are lovely and clean, and the decor is a nice change from standard hotel decor -- much lighter and airier. The customer service is first rate. It is also very pet friendly, with what I consider to be a reasonable extra fee for accommodating your pet. There are also plenty of walkways in the area for dog walking. Our corgi loves it! We are looking forward to returning later in March 2012 for 2 nights.",2

"This place is amazing! I've lived in NC my whole life and while this isn't your mom and pop BBQ joints I am so fond of from my childhood, Midwood is a perfect blend of authenticity and creativity. The \""secret\"" is that the folks here really care. They sincerely want you to have a great time, serve you some amazing food, and have you leave with a smile. \n\nOn my most recent trip, my girlfriend took me to Midwood for my birthday. Although there was a line, they quickly seated us and we were greeted by our waiter Jimmy who was attentive and friendly. I always get the BBQ sampler with double dry ribs, smoked sausage, and fatty brisket. I had been hesitant to try the bacon wrapped jalapenos because I saw some complaints on Yelp. But on Jimmy's recommendation, we got an order and they were to die for! Really, really delicious. \n\nTheir meats are perfectly smoked, full of flavor, consistently moist, and always memorable. If you're looking for a great, fun, foodie place - look no further than Midwood Smokehouse!\n\nP.S. Their hushpuppies are the best I've ever had!",2

"Though I like E.E. ""Doc"" Smith's books and David A. Kyles books of Lensman, the anime, which is loosly based on the books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.Though the story may seem familiar to Sci-Fi/Fantasy buffs, such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family, it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless. Plus, Lensman was THE first Animated motion picture to use hand drawn and CG animation all at once. Sure, it may look a bit outdated now, but it is still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, none of that would have ever happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics look better in animation that live action.)Too bad they only released it on DVD/VCD in a few countries in the worls (mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different). I just wish they release the Lensman movie and tv series on DVD/VCD in EVERY part of the world, not just certain parts.P.S. Worsel rules! I just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well.",2

There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp. We will definitely be back to dine again.",2

"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however is present.) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been restored for this version. It is truly beautiful and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive ""Lady Luck"" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic of the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will love this.",2

"This was a really good hotel to stay at. We decided last minute that we wanted to spend the night near the airport rather than drive home late at night. We reserved the room from the airport and everything was ready for us when we arrived. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We needed some extra bedding at midnight and they accommodated. They don't have housekeeping services that time of night but I was able to go to the front desk and they went to housekeeping and got the bedding for me.
Everything was clean and well maintained. The atrium was very nice with a lot of water and koi and goldfish swimming in one of the pools. It added a really nice touch.
Breakfast in the morning was very good - what I expected from Embassy Suites.
The internet worked well and I had no problem accessing it. There is a 10.95 fee unless you're a HHonors Gold member.
I'd definitely use this hotel again.",2

"I moved to AZ from CA in 2012, and coincidentally, my CA preparer retired at the same time, so I had to find someone here ASAP, and saw some of the previous YELP reviews. Tom was easily able to handle my federal return as well as both the CA and AZ returns. He caught a couple of deductions that I had overlooked (and then he explained them to me in detail, citing the specifics of the law, and why they were completely allowable). In addition, he answered a lot of questions about my goal of early retirement, and gave me great guidance about how to structure my finances for a stable flow of income. He analyzed the issue of when to take Social Security (and the answer can be different for all of us, based on dozens of different factors), and set me on the right track there. He's also available during the course of the year for many what-if questions: \n\n1) Should I refinance my mortgage?\n2) Is it better to just make additional payments in order to retire it sooner?\n3) At what point is the standard deduction greater than my mortgage interest?\n4) How much can I earn and not lose any of my Social Security when I'm under 66?\n5) When and how does my Social Security become taxable based on other income?\n6) For additional retirement income, do I draw on taxable or non-taxable IRAs first?\n7) Should I open a regular or a Roth IRA this year?\n8) When should I consider converting some/all of a regular IRA to a Roth?\n9) When can I reasonably afford to retire?\n\nYou get the idea--so many financial decisions today can have a lot of impact on a person's overall situation. Tom and his staff are knowledgeable, efficient, and very pleasant to work with.",2

Light fixtures in the bathroom were very worn, ceiling had stains and bathroom fixtures leaked water. At one time is was a very nice place but someone responsible has let it slip.

This is one of my favorite places in the Pittsburgh area I've been here numerous times. The draft beer is always good but don't except a ton of choices to be on tap all at once. Don't listen to the negative reviews by the annoying foodies and hipsters. I mean seriously are they ever happy? They build a place in Pittsburgh that does not revolve around sports and TV's yet they still complain. The menu has all sorts of things on it and I love the German potato salad and the red apple kraut. The place can get really busy and loud though so if you're the type of person that is turned off by that I recommend trying to go when it is more low key. In the warmer months there is outdoor seating that is used but in the colder months everyone is inside.,2

The sausage is prepared in house , so fresh you can taste it. The shredded chicken was juicy , and the roasted garlic was cooked just right! I'd be mad too had I not made it on time! The pizza pie was damn good! \n To be honest , they can close their doors whenever they like. They got it like that. Just be sure you order plenty ahead of time. They have families and want to go home just like us. \n\n I will be back ... and I will try the garlic knots I forgot to order !",2

Not a big fan of the glass wall shower that has a white curtain so that you're not visible to whoever is in the room. But since we were just staying 1 night before leaving for a cruise all was well. Would go back again!",2
Omg. The hubby and I ate here last night for dinner on our random getaway to Phoenix AZ. Its a diamond in the rough! The staff was so amazing. You felt the love when you walk in the door... the food was so tastey! And never once was our cup empty! We were so full and satisfied Well worth the drive from Riverside CA. The hubby says we'll definitely be back!,2

"One of my favorite restaurants!\n\nTheir food is just incredible and the portions are generous. I'm absolutely addicted to their pad thai, and they have a homemade pineapple dressing that is unbelievably good. (Take it from someone that doesn't even like salad, this stuff rocks!) \n\nThe place is small but clean, and the staff is very friendly. The only con is that the servers can be a little slow on the refills and check, which may be a turnoff for some. Personally, I think the quality food here is well worth the wait. \n\nI always thought their spice was a little weak, but I recently tried a ten and found out how very wrong I was. They can definitely appeal to spice lovers and haters alike. I'd definitely recommend Thai Chili for almost any occasion",2
I ordered a display PCB and control PCB for my faulty fridge freezer. These were delivered promptly and at a reasonable price. It turned out that I only required the display PCB so returned the control PCB and received a full refund. My whole experience with espares was excellent and I would have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone considering ordering from this company.,2
"Healthy eating in a fun atmosphere. Im a vegetarian; my husband isnt so I was thrilled he wanted to go. Theres protein options so theres really something for everyone. \nThe 3 of us all had wraps - chicken, steak and veggie. All came with a small salad. We also got a side of mac and cheese - good flavor but the texture was different. \nThe wraps were large amd tasty. The workers were all friendly and very happy. \nIts such a clean, bright, cheery place. Would definitely go back.",2

"Pleasant enough when walking thru the entranceway in one of the best locations in New York. You are directly accross from the back entrance to the Essex House which would take my entire months social security check for 1 night. For a single there was room enough for a bed and thats about it. I booked the room but was surprised by $20 in tax. I needed a magnifying glass to find that info on my reservation receipt. The elevator was broken so they gave me a room on the 2nd floor which was very nice of them. Again the location 1 block to Carnegie Hall, 1 block to Central Park. It was a good overall experience except for the room size.",2
"I just...I find this place to be very unfair. Why is it in Phoenix when I live in Tucson? Why does it have way better hummus, chicken schwarma, gyros and babaganoush than anywhere I can find in Tucson? Why do they have better home-made feta cheese than anywhere in Tucson? Why, Haji-Baba? Why? I want answers!\n\nI really love hole-in-the-wall places. This place is no exception. Their hummus was described to me as \""creamy\"" and I made a vomit noise. But it is totally creamy. But not with dairy, it's like they put it through a mill or something, because a food processor could never in a million years make it that smooth.\n\nThe babaganoush was tangy and flavorful, served with freaking amazing pita bread that was warm. The chicken schwarma was...I don't know that words can describe it. Basically anything I say will make is sound not as good as it was. Divine doesn't cut it. Juicy, perfectly cooked, exploding with flavor...I mean...they work for now. I will make up a word soon that adequately describes it.\n\nThe gyro was spectacular. The meat was seasoned to tender perfection, and they put home made feta cheese on it! The feta cheese is not nearly as salty as any other kind I have ever had, and it was way creamier.\n\nWe had rose-water lemonade, which I have indeed found in Tucson. At the street fair. You know, the one that happens twice a year? I am pretty happy to find a place that has it year-round!",2

"I have this movie on DVD and must have watched it thirty times by now. I must really love it, right? Well, not really.I was a surfer earlier in my life, and I loved the sport. To this day, I am fascinated by good surfing. Riding Giants has plenty of that, and thus I am a sucker for the thing. But I definitely have some bones to pick with it. (Peralta, you listening?).First, the movie has too little faith in its subject matter. The cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined. Very, very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish. Peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic, cut-and-pace method. It gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot Mavericks in Northern California. Not a single wave is ridden start to finish. Almost the entire section on Mavericks (one third of the movie) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack. I can understand the effect Peralta was trying to achieve with Mavericks, as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop, but he goes way too far. Mavericks is not just a bad acid trip. Waves are actually ridden there, even with great performances. It would have been good to see some of them. If Peralta thinks this is a grand sport (and I am sure he does), then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much? At times, the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable. There is one fast clip in the section on Peahi in Hawaii, which I still cannot understand. Even if I run it on slow motion on DVD, the image is too fast to be decipherable. It must be a couple of frames in length at the max.Second, have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement? It is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors' version on DVD. These guys sound like two over-the-top valley girls. The same sentiment shows up in the main production. Every thing is always so goddamn ""amazing"" etc. One character in particular is just plain obnoxious -- Sam George, the editor of Surfer Magazine, who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say. He is a super drag on the movie.There is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie. I mean, just to get the old movie shots they have, and also, all of the interviews. The movie is a great story, and I think it is generally captivating entertainment. Thematically it is well laid out, with the three parts centering around Greg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton respectively. There are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal. In the directors' narration, they say it is a new type of 3D technology, and it really works. The three principle characters shine, both in their interviews and in the water. As an athlete, Laird Hamilton is a revelation. He rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that I have only seen Michael Jordan do in basketball. And too, the story of his meeting his father is a gem. It really touched me.It is just that the movie could have been so much more. The very last part of the movie, when the credits roll, gives a hint of what it could have been. There are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack. (The soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish, though you may like it if you are fan of the modern, frenetic school of rock.) Anyway there's my two cents...",2

"Everything from choosing the right kind of build, to processing, to delivery has been really easy and smooth. Although it's been a long wait for some parts to arrive, the team made sure to update me on the progress of my order. I guess the email I receive every 5 days is a good feature from your service as it eased the anxiety of waiting for my PC or if it will be built a longer time than expected. As for the product, it has been working really well and has been perfect so far. Thank you so much!
I would also like to commend the people behind the customer service hotline as they were very patient and helpful when I had questions prior to receiving my order as well as when I called when I needed help setting up my PC when it arrived. I am grateful and I appreciate you all.

We stayed here two nights in a suite. I'd hate to see a regular room. We were on third floor and felt like we were in the basement. No windows poor lighting very depressing.

"Stayed here for an anniversary weekend with my husband. This used to be the Helmsley Hotel and the location is great - 3rd Ave and 42nd - close to subway, easy walk to all the action in midtown. We asked for an upgrade (we're Gold Starwood members) and first the guy said he had nothing and then he said he had a nice room for us - the room was fine, perhaps a little larger than the usual NYC hotel rooms - it was a corner room so had a short hallway and a seating area. The bathroom was standard Westin quality with a walk in shower - but why does the tap have to be so far away that you get wet when you turn on the shower? As usual the bed was very comfy and the sheets of good quality. Our sheets were changed every day - something that does not seem to happen automatically any more. My pet peeve with ever Starwood I have stayed at in NYC is that there is often something missing after the room is cleaned - this time it was a bath mat one day. The staff must be under great pressure to get rooms done and they seem not to check when things are missing - or just don't go back to replace something.
That said, the hotel was recently redone so it is clean and shiny. The lobby does get very busy at times and it is quite small. I usually stay at the W on Lexington Ave and this is a very good alternative - I'd probably stay here in future rather than at the W which is getting old and tired. The gym here is also way better - large, clean with new machines.",2

They did not have room service, if you got food from the restuarant you couldn't charge it to your room and they don't serve breakfast. It's basically a room to sleep in. My room in particular was next to the fire escape which made me feel very unsafe since there was a door to the outside right outside my room. The noise was ridiculous - a water running noise all day and night and thin walls make you hear every sneeze from adjacent rooms - and even knocks on other doors. The housekeeping staff and engineering staff was very friendly. Oh, and the TV is smaller than your computer screen. Unfortunately, be careful in the tub, its slippery and no grip mat.",2

"Broken Silence or ""Race Against Fear""1998): Starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson...Director Joseph Scanlan, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy.This is another Lifetime channel film, made exclusively for television, released in 1998, directed by long-time TV series director Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by true events, it's a lot like the majority of Lifetime movies, a cautionary tale for women, raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family (a mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case track coach). The young and little known actress Ariana Richards (she played the small girl in Jurassic Park)delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by her coach, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story, except for, of course, her own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film drags on quite a bit, is ultimately predictable, at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself, but is genuinely powerful in the end. Ariana Richards' performance is of the daytime soap kind, but she is the strongest in the entire cast. Her facial expressions, body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, is in turn violated by him and must now live with the shame, trauma and further, fight him in court. William Bumiller plays the part with a nasty sort of duplicity, though he is far from subtle. He has abused other star athletes before, who have remained silent and made it to the top, and appears outwardly innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser-known actors like the others, has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall. It's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera ""Guiding Light"". The only real problem I had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured. As the film opens, we watch Coach Ansom about to rape Mickey, letting us know right away that this guy is no good. But this makes for weak character development and story. If the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see Mickey running/jogging in the city across a lake, we would have better character development because we don't know that Coach Ansom, while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete, is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen Mickey idolizing a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to drama for TV (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outer Limits, Lois And Clark, Earth Final Conflict and movies like La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan had directed another Lifetime movie, similar to this, ""Stand Against Fear"" (1996). He manages to convey the gravity of the event. We are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student. These scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences, but its message is clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can assume different forms, and their preying grounds can even include a high school. This film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists will cause no further harm to others. Despite other negative reviews, this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers, daughters, high school students (including both male and female). As bad as rape is, staying silent when it happens is even worse.",2
"It is a new, clean place, with in general reasonable rooms. Price level is standard to others around. OK to stay, but will not be comfortable, as you have to tolerate the following:
.-Lifts slow and crowded. Especially because the housekeeping staff with laundry carts use same lifts as guests. On our 3 day stay, on numerous occasions, housekeeping would crowd a cart into an already crowded lift cage, hold the doors open to talk with housekeepers on various floors where the lift stopped. 5 minute waits normal.
.-Breakfast -- free, and no complaint -- also crowded at peak times around 9 am. Long lines, no seating.
.-Room air conditioners seemed to be of the binary control (blast cold air, blast hot air) type. If you can, dont take the 2xbedded rooms, as in these the AC unit blasts direct into the closest bed. Try the king room, seems to be better.
.-Little coordination between front desk and housekeeping on reservations. One day, housekeeping knocked 4 times to ask when are we leaving, when we weren't going to. On another day, our two rooms were not made up as housekeeping was waiting for us to depart, which we were not scheduled to do. An hour to sit in lobby while housekeeping was rescheduled to do the rooms.
.-One of two reservations lost by reception, and had to be dug up from emails.
The reservation issues seem teething problems in a newly opened place, and should quickly get sorted. Others are a tougher challenge.
This hotel is a ""sister"" or the Candlewood Suites and Hampton Inn brands next door (literally 5 and 10 meters away). Prices appear quite similar. Would recommend trying those two as alternatives in case internal details are any better there. But especially housekeeping staff seemed to be a mix and match of the brand uniforms, so may not have much meaning.",2

"My worst stay at this hotel. I stay there about every 6-8 weeks, always in a suite. I have asked repeatedly not to be given room 225. So when I showed up this time what room did I get – 225. Any other similar room was “not available.” The refriferator was not working. After crawling around on the floor in a poorly lit room I figured out it was unplugged. I plugged the power in – still did not work. Engineering brought a new one and said he didn’t know why the other unit was there – they were “no good.” Next I went for ice. The ice machines on the second floor, the third floor, and the fourth floor were all out of order. There were big holes in the closet wall as if someone had ripped the safe off the wall and no one had repaired the damage..
I hate to leave on a sour note, so I must note that, while Sr. mgmt was unreachable, the front line staff was and always is friendly and courteous.
All in all, it was a distressing visit, and probably my last one. Even though Le Meridien is closer to my business and somewhat less expensive, it is back to the InterContinental for me!",2

"Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances. I really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon, so you better go and see this one while you can. Despite its relentless grimness, I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing, and he pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one, but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.",2

"Delightful! It never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it's a mini-gem of late seventies British comedy. Given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it stars an American (the late character actor Richard Jordan), but at least he isn't the usual dull Hollywood hunk type. Surrounding him is the cream of British character acting talent, led by a wonderfully waspish and superior David Niven.Niven's Ivan the Terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of Niven as being only a light drawing room comedy star. He is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how Ivan earned his nickname. All the more surprising given how ill Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last picture Niven made where you can hear his own voice, being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist Sid Caesar.Alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television. Elke Sommer (flashing her breasts in true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye etc, etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call. ""Who you ringing?!....Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless git!"" Great shots of London street locations; making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round-dial manual handsets, black cabs driven by ""Cor blimey, gov!"" cockneys, and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy late seventies retro leisure wear and hair styles. Unlike the classic Ealing comedies of an earlier era, the 'hero' is allowed to get away with his crime and escape to a life in the sun. How times had changed! The morality code by which crooks in films always had to be seen to be punished had long gone by the seventies, with anti-heroes like Pinky Green earning status through their cheeky anti-authoritarianism and determination to 'cock a snook' at a stuffy capitalist establishment of be-suited fat cat businessmen. We are encouraged to cheer as Pinky makes off, unpunished and free as a bird with his ill gotten gains. Compare that to the ending of The Lavender Hill Mob!Highly entertaining, quaintly dated in its fashions and attitudes, and the stuff of late night cult viewing. Perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut; if you're of a certain age, are feeling a touch nostalgic, and have always wanted to see David Niven in a branch of McDonalds, silently intimidating an American via the use of a retractable telescope!",2

It is more of a simple styled sushi restaurant but it is by far one of my favorites for lunch or afternoon pick-me-up. This place will not disappoint and the wait staff is incredibly friendly.,2
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I love it so much to the point where I'll drive great distances to get my AYCE sushi fix here. This place is absolutely worth driving any length, consuming every calorie and cutting your night short to fall into (as the name of the place suggests) a Sushi Koma and sleeping happily ever after afterwards.\n\nThis place is FRESH. Everything from the fish, to the seafood, even the appetizers, is probably the best you're going to get in Vegas with an AYCE concept restaurant. You can also order A La Carte from the regular menu but let's face it, dining patrons here take advantage of trying every single delectable item this place has to offer. \n\nIf you're a nigiri feen like myself, definitely try every single nigiri on the menu to see what I'm talking about, freshness wise. The appetizer menu is amazing as well. The Brie & Grape Quesadilla is a must try and I always find myself ordering about three of these during every visit. It's interestingly good!\n\nThe service here is always on point as well. My beverage cup is never empty, my table is never piling with empty plates and my sushi orders arrive simultaneously so you can actually enjoy everything while it's fresh. If you happen to be sitting along the sushi bar and have a chance to talk with Moon (the owner and head chef) during your meal, let him know that Julie Tran says hi. I'm always a low key walking billboard for this place if I know you're craving sushi and wouldn't mind spending a little bit of my time informing you about how amazing this place is.",2

"""A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something.""--Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of ""Watch on the Rhine"" could not come at a better moment. It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship). It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose.Sure, you say, like we needed that. We've heard Cary Grant sermonizing in ""Destination Tokyo"" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in ""The Sound of Music"" (1965). We've toured an England callously occupied by Germany in ""It Happened Here"" (1966). Yet, truth to tell, we still need the message spread.I have an 81-year-old friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we didn't need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. He's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan.The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles hadn't confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.Some commenters on this site feel that ""Watch"" sags under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point: Some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and ""enough"" didn't appear in their vocabulary.Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines, for actively facing down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman didn't care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian he had seen first-hand Bela Kun's bloody ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny.In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause, although he insults Herr Blecher ""the Butcher"" and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader.Teck, a pauper and possible cuckold, wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering Great War and the greater world-wide economic Depression. He has no political convictions, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burnt-out case's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace.Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme's and de Brancovis' privileged kind. However, this family hasn't seen ruin and never will. They're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan. ""Watch on the Rhine"" has a manicured period look. Its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. Yet Hellman and Hammett's film has gut-based power. Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march.",2

This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time). This was a BBC production and ran in the U.S. on American Playhouse. There is such an interest in seeing this--just hard to believe no one can make it available.,2

"This was truly a GREAT hotel experience in the heart of New York. Before I even travelled I corresponded with the General Manager Mr. Hunter Glass several times making inquiries. He kindly and promptly answered all of my questions and took care of my requests perfectly. A great start of holidays even before reaching your hotel destination.
Have spent 5 nights at Hampton Inn Madison Square Garden (16-21 May) and it was perfect in every way. Bedroom had 2 large beds, clean and comfortable, with a modern and functional bathroom! Room located on the 16th floor with peak view of The Big Apple skyscrapers, thoughtfully equipped with tea/coffee making facilities, TV, phone, iron and ironing board and the most important for the tourist a complimentary wireless internet access... It was very quiet and the bed was very, very comfortable.
Breakfast, which was included in the rate, was tasty with a variety of treats, including fresh fruits, hot options & delicious breads and doughnuts. The coffee was terrific one of the best I have experienced in the hotel restaurants!
It is very convenient to walk from the hotel to The Time Square and 5th Avenue shops. You could not go wrong with its location. Just to mention the LIRR transportation from JFK to Pen Station, from where just a 5 minutes’ walk to the hotel.
All in all I had a great stay and the hotel really did make it for me. What a pleasant change to stay somewhere that the staff really seemed to want to be there and help. Well done. Please pass this onto your staff as they deserve the praise!!!
I would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends.
Thanks again for making me feel welcome!",2
Absolutely love the service & ambient. Briyani was great and other food was satisfactory. But very pricey.,2

Plus, you can learn a lot of neat-o computer tricks.",2

Went their because my husband and I were being honored in NYC. The hotel was beautiful. It is a bit pricey but the service is great. It was close to many attractions. I did not give it 5 stars because they closed the lobby one day for a wedding. We felt a little shortchanged not being able to enjoy the lobby.,2

"A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The love and support of the family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. The commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.",2
"I have tried lots of froyo. I'm kinda' a conisseur (sp?) at this point. I do love the Dulce de Leche here. I'm not as big a fan of most of their other flavors, my my daughter loves their red velvet.

"Anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. I have watched it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. Fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her.The cast of ""Soapdish"" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, as are Robert Downey Jr., an ingénue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious.This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years. You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.",2

"Pros: Friendly Staff...always nice and even greeted our little ones by name on our way in/out of the hotel. Location was perfect for everything we wanted, 1 block from magnificient mile, beside Ginos East and about a 10 minute walk to the Navy Pier
Cons: Hotel is clean, but shows signs of wear. Blinds were broken in room and were eventually fixed. We left an item in the room upon check out and it wasnt recovered by housekeeping...which seems to be a pattern nationwide. Parking is $49.00 per day OUCH!!
I would stay here again as its the perfect location for what our family wanted to do in Chicago",2

"We are former NYC residents & this hotel is ideally located to restaurants, museums, theatres, Rockefeller Ctr, etc. Room on top floor had great view & was well equipped. Breakfast included was complete [not continental] w/ cooked to order eggs any style. Hotel has a limo co. available for ride back to LGA for $35 cash including tolls, which is much nicer than NYC taxi. Desk & other employees were very helpful. There is a single computer w/ internet access avail on 12 fl so u don't need to bring ur own to check ur emails, etc.",2

Das Hotel ist sehr sauber. Frühstück war nicht im Preis inbegriffen. Im Hotel befindet sich ein Restaurant, das Frühstück dort ist sehr gut, aber relativ teuer.
Tipp für die Abreise: Der freundliche Mensch bei der Kofferaufbewahrung läßt keine Gelegenheit aus, einen Limo-Service zum Flughafen anzupreisen. --> Würde ich nicht machen. Direkt vor dem Hotel kann man jederzeit ein Taxi anhalten. Der Fahrpreis zu Flughafen ist 30-50% günstiger.",2

"Travelled from South Africa to Bali.
Duration of flight 10.5hrs to Singapore and then 2.5hrs to Bali. Slight flight delays was experienced due to bad weather but the captain made it up in the air.
Planes are old if compared to Qatar or Emirates Airlines therefore the leg room is less and the economy class movie screens are smaller. A plus is that there is onboard WIFI available which was stable for a good few hours into the flight but it is rather expensive.
Service by airhostess was excellent, very friendly and always willing to help. The only downside is that they will wake you from sleep when it is time to eat. I would much prefer to sleep and eat when ready.",2

We had breakfast at the Gemini Diner (as per a previous recommendation on 2nd Ave and 35th)... was really good for someone looking for a typical american diner experience. Guy and Gallard good for breakfast too.
Staff very helpful and really nice too. We had a problem with the heating and it was fixed no problem. Room quiet apart from the toilet (?) cistern, but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't bother me at all so I didn't complain.
Of the 3 times I've stayed in NY, this was by far the best location and the room was huge (and we only had a studio!)",2

"We stayed for two nights and it was a very nice room. Plenty big for my husband, teenage daughter and her friend. Clean and nice.

The people there were very nice and the room was very attractive. Definitely will stay here again.",2

"Stayed 1 night in May 2012. Hotel met expectations with the usual breakfast crowd crush if you go near the ending time. While it's a straight walk up Congress across the bridge into the center, it is quite a walk to 6th where all the action is - allow 20 minutes. Big disappointment was - NO BATs. For the unenlightened, there used to be a famous ""flock"" of bats living beneath the bridge on Congress street. This is a major Austin tourist attraction and when we were there we went the TGIF's just on the other side of the bridge from the hotel to see them come out at night. Our waiter confessed that they had gone to Mexico on their usual migration, but had not returned. Something to do with climate change and the availability of insects, their food source. This fact seemed to be hidden from tourists because a large crowd still gathered along the bridge walkways to see them. If you're looking for the bats, suggest you check prior to see if they ever came back to Austin before you go.",2

"Satisfaction depends on expectations. From what I had read about this hotel my expectations were high. Did I get my expectations fulfilled? I was not overwhelmed or surprised by anything special in this hotel during my stay, but on the other side I did not have any bad experiences either.
This is a nice hotel with a friendly staff, a spacious lobby area, and I got a nice room (when I at last found it after walking through what at first time seemed to be a maze like system of corridors). The view from my room was nothing special, but the room was quiet, the bed was also very comfortable and I slept very well.The bathroom was quite large, there were a lot of toiletries and the towels and robes were plush, The shower had excellent waterpressure. Breakfast was good.
The location of the hotel is a bit away from everything and not very central. I attended a conference at this hotel so I was busy most of the time and for that purpose I did not need to be close to the city center nor tourist attractions.
My conclusion: Very good hotel, but there was nothing ""really special"" about it which would make me want to come back.",2
Andrew's was recommended by friends so we went Saturday night and the food was brilliant. I had the Malaysian Chicken Curry which was spicy but very tasty and my partner had Sizzling Chicken and we shared a Kampung Rice. Portions were good and Andrew was very friendly and helped us chose. Quite a few tables were reserved so he is always busy. Can highly recommend this as prices only slightly higher than the Hawker Stalls.,2

We stayed here recently to visit some colleges with our son. I had read some other reviews on tripadvisor and they were very helpful. We were able to check in quickly because of my silver elite status. I had requested a room in the tower building and was told on the phone that there were no guarantees. They gave us a great room in the tower. We asked for 2 double beds but they gave us a large room with a king bed and a pull out sofa. We got a rollaway cot and it was still plenty big for four people. Tall ceilings and a large window made the room seem even bigger. The room was super clean and bed was very comfy. The hotel's location allowed us to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go. The Reading Terminal Market is right across the street and we enjoyed going in there more than once. The lobby is large and noisy and the bar in the center is a bit pricey as is the valet parking but the great room and location of this hotel more than make up for it. Internet is not free for everyone and there is no business center. There were far more pros than cons at this hotel. We would choose it again.,2
"Great location close to shops and attractions. Very handy for nightlife and good restaurants and reasonable walk from subway, including to O'Hare.
Had a great spacious room. Very friendly staff.
I booked on Priceline so can't comment on value ($92 on Priceline is good value for me...but not sure what direct booking would be!).
Didn't use much of the food options apart from coffee n the morning which was a Starbucks in the hotel, but very busy.",2
"The hotel has a great courteous staff. However, the rooms are so tiny they feel like an airplane’s bathroom. There’s also the issue of noise. The walls are so thin I could clearly hear a couple fighting a floor below.",2
"Stayed here for two nights and our stay was very pleasant. The hotel looks a bit shabby from the outside but the rooms were modern,clean and comfortable and the pool was very nice.Parking was a bit expensive but we were in a city. Staff very helpful and the restaurant was very good for an evening meal and for breakfast.",2
"I'm extremely pleased with my stay at this hotel. Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and pleasant. Everything about this hotel screams perfection. Where you really saw it was in the rooms. I was overwhelmed by the cleanliness of my room as well as the overall decor and size of room. As others mention, the beds are extremely comfortable for a perfect night sleep! A rare commodity in most hotels. High end bath products were offered as well as Evian water every night I was there. Location of this hotel is extremely convenient. Everything truly is walking distance of the hotel. I was surprised to see the internet wasn't extremely overpriced compared to other hotels I've been in. $7.95 for every 24 hours. Definitely will stay at this hotel on my next trip to Philadelphia.",2

"L'hôtel est très bien situé à deux pas de la station de bus et de Métro de Port Authority.
Les chambres sont petites et très biens concues. Le lit rétractable est une très bonne idée et permet un gain de place dans la chambre et c'est aussi très pratique pour regarder la TV.
La salle de bain donne sur une grande baie vitrée ce qui offre une très belle vue en prenant sa douche.
Nous avons aimés également la salle disponible sur chaque étage pour se faire un café du thé,un chocolat chaud, capuccino ou de l'eau fraiche sans sup et le petit déjeuner avec les muffins à volonté.Nous avons aussi aimé l'accès à internet gratuit à l'hôtel et le check in et check out quasi automatique qui prend 30 sec.

During our stay at The Danna Langkawi we often had a drink or two in the Verandah. It is a beautiful room with high ceilings and very comfortable arm chairs and sofas to relax in.

"We stayed at this Marriott for 3 nights. Check in was quick. Although the rooms need a bit of updating (dated decor, bed spread, wallpaper...), our room was very clean, large and we had a lot of space to put our luggage. A big bonus was the complimentary free Wi-Fi service throughout the hotel.
The3 hotel is situated in a pretty good location. There is a Duane Reade drug store next door (snacks, water, travelling essentials...). There are many restaurants nearby. We walked everywhere (but then again, we walk quite a bit). The Rockefeller is just 4 blocks away, and it's a 15 minute walk to get to Central Park. For those that don't enjoy walking, the subway is just 1 block outside the door (Lexington).
We enjoyed the free coffee offered every morning. We would then head to the Ess-a-bagel for breakfast (cappuccino and a bagel with flavored cream cheese) before sight seeing. The Ess-a-bagel is just one block or two across the street from the hotel.
The concierge was most helpful and recommended really great restaurants for dinner based on our mood for that evening (fine dining, pizza, burgers...). He was more than helpful, pleasant and knowledgeable. He really impressed me.
Parking was expensive ! However, it's valet parking and we didn't want to drive around in the madness to look for a cheaper parking garage.",2
"This place gets five stars almost by default. It is extremely clean, extremely well organized and impeccably presented!\n\nIf you like to shop for groceries while toting your Fendy clutch - this is the place to be.\n\nPricier than your average place! But hey - luxury ain't cheap!",2

"We were very satisfied with our stay at the Philly Airport Marriott. Check-in was quick and the front desk staff were friendly. Room was clean with a nice decor. The bedding was very comfortable and the tv was fine (although not high def, but we didn't really care). It was easy to get to the parking garage, but there is a $22 parking fee.
It was a quick, easy ride to get to the Wells Fargo Center (which is right next to Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park).
The bar/restaurant looked nice but we did not use it at all, just peeked in.
I'd have no qualms about recommending this hotel.",2
"I love this place. Drinks are cheap and the new food menu is surprisingly delish (think upgraded bar food). Night crowd varies dramatically based on what bands are playing and 97% of their shows are FREE! Weeee!

"It had been several years since we stayed in Seattle. I knew we wanted to be in the downtown area- so I looked up DT hotels on line. Hotel Monaco was a four star hotel that came up along with several others-a bit out of our price range, but in looking at their web-site- they offered a better rate for two days. It was perfect for us. The hotel was beautiful- the staff were very courteous and most helpful. They had great suggestions for resturants and places to visit. The rooms were spacious and super clean. Great showers. We will definitely be back!",2

"Stayed here for 2 nights for the Dave Matthews Band concert at Nationals Ballpark. We got there at about 4pm on a weekday, so we easily found a parking spot in that crazy garage (Lifters?! Amazing!). We have been to DC once before for a week and stayed by the Rosslyn Metro stop. It was definitely a contrast in the areas, but we really enjoyed this location. The Metro is really easy to get to, and only two stops from the National Mall. It was sooo HOT that we really limited our time outside, so we found the Metro really easy to use, even when when we went to Georgetown. We used the Foggy Bottom stop and walked up Pennsylvania if you are looking to get there. The Hotel room was very nice and comfortable, though we were disapointed we couldn't get free wi-fi. The only other gripe I have is that there are no vending machines except by purchase from the front desk. After our concert, where we sweated like crazy from the humidy, we planned to just grab some water from our floor's vending machine but there wasn't one! The elevators were super busy and we were too gross to go back down to the lobby. I was annoyed. Everything else about this hotel is great and we would stay here again for a short stay that included a ballgame. Otherwise I might agree with others that some areas are a bit nicer to stay in long term. BTW, drivers in this area are loony. I'll take Las Vegas and LA drivers over DC drivers anyday. Super aggressive mini-vans and SUVs!",2

"The Order of the Four Sons, or O4S as the modern organization call itself, is under attack. Teams are disappearing on missions, yet events that demand their attention are on the rise in frequency and intensity. After sending out every spare group of people, even the main office's administrative staff, they bring in a misfit crew to investigate a mysterious phone call received just that day from an agent who disappeared 20 years ago from a small town called Excelsior Springs.Set in the modern day, this story is not focused on Egyptian mythology, despite the description and the intro chapter. I found this to be action-packed and interesting. The banter between the teammates is natural and often humorous. The setting in Excelsior Springs, including the history involved, is also impressive. I was surprised and pleased with the historical fiction aspects of the story, many of which involved this little town. It was clever to link a famous historical figure with O4S, though I don't want to say who the figure is due to spoilers. The old hotel and the alternate old hotel are both extremely creepy, especially due to the creatures and ghosts that inhabit them.Murphy, Bill and Kate are my favorites from the team. Murphy, the detective, is a sceptic; even after he finds himself transported to another dimension, he still refuses to believe, though he deals with what he's experiencing. Bill monitors, records and coordinates the efforts of the team as they investigate. He pops in with humorous remarks and seems to be their tether to the real world. Finally, Kate, the apprentice mage who thought she was simply coming for her first training mission, instead finds herself on a desperate mission, facing terrifying enemies.And those terrifying enemies are numerous and varied. Counted among them are ghosts, demons, immortal serial killers, and the particularly nasty spirit that spawned The Order of the Four Sons in the first place.Overall, I really enjoyed this story, particularly the historical fiction and the ongoing battle between good and evil. This is the first in a series, so the book ends off with a set up for the next one. I'd recommend this book for those who like books with interesting characters, historical tie ins, and cameos by famous (and infamous) historical figures. Others may enjoy the paranormal spin on a story set in the modern world.",2

"Having visited the Phoenix area two weeks ago I stumbled across this GEM of a restaurant! My mouth exploded with such rich flavors of the south it was truly a wonderful mix of New Orleans, South Carolina, and a bit of Texas thrown in there. Not to mention the specialty cocktails ROCKED. So to move on to the atmosphere I thought it was equally exciting with rich texture,s including the ceiling with its little secret. And the train that runs say every 15 min. or just adds the charm. It just had this fabulous hustle bustle about it. \nThe servers were attentive, the hostess was CHARMING, and we will certainly return again when we move here permanently in September. \n\np.s can you deliver out of state until we move here?.",2
"This Comfort Inn is a conference center, so it appears to be a step up from your average Comfort Inn. The hotel was very busy during the weekend we were there. A huge car show was happening at several hotels in the area, plus the large softball tournament that my daughter was in. In spite of this, the hotel managed the crowd. The breakfast area was kept stocked even when very busy. There is adequate seating as long as turnover remains high. Overall, the hotel was clean and well-maintained. One woman in our party had a very negative experience with the maintenance staff. She called for maintenance, and the worker walked into the room without knocking - and the woman was not dressed. She complained to the front desk, who did not understand English. The same can be said of others on the staff. Note that this hotel does not have an elevator. It is also a large hotel because of the conference center, and we had to walk a long distance to get to our room from the lobby. Luckily there are many auxiliary entrances. Parking was an issue on our weekend because of the car show that was going on in the lot, but that is an unusual situation. The hotel is located in the north end of Columbus among a lot of shopping, and the excellent Easton Town Center is a short drive away. I would stay here again in the future.",2

"We stayed for 4 nights in September - had a 1 bedroom suite with our 2 teenagers.
Great location - subway outside front door, close to Times Square and Central Park.
Our room viewed the other buildings and our teenagers viewed the main street. Not a big deal - it's NYC - if you're at the back of the building, you view another building - unless you are on the top floors.
Kitchenette was over-rated - you get a fridge and stove top - no microwave, cutlery, pots, dishes - plan to eat out. We ate at Fluffy's and a small restaurant on 56 Street - good prices, nice people.
Close to Central Park - rented bikes for 2 hours and rode around Park and along the Hudson River - really interesting.
Close to Times Square - went to see Lion King and In the Heights - both great shows

"I missed my flight and was given a $55 voucher for this property. It's about 15 min. from the airport and they had a shuttle that took us and brought us back in the AM. The guy that checked our van in was friendly and efficient, dealing with the stress well. My only fault with him was that he mentioned everyone's room number, loud enough for everyone to hear. I asked him not to announce mine and he respected my wishes. He signed me up for the 5:30AM shuttle and asked if I'd like a wake-up call. The room was surprisingly big and very comfortable. At 1AM (when I got in) the tv next door to me was quite loud but I made a quick call to the guest and he turned the volume down. I was on the first floor and heard a lot of folks going to the elevator but it wasn't too bad. Where I was super impressed was that the breakfast buffet didn't start until 6am but the same front desk guy knowing that a bunch of cranky passengers were on the 5:30 shuttle had breakfast ready around 5:15 for us. It was a well-appreciated touch.",2

"Seeing this film, or rather set of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. This monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical setting, reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is. The people are portrayed as they are to themselves: their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception. Edgar Reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings.When these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. When I saw these films I perceived my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events. I acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I only wish the BBC would screen it again.If anyone knows where I can get a copy, could they contact me",2
"Good
Convenient location just off 3rd Avenue - ideal for Midtown sightseeing / business
Clean
Could not locate any reports of bed bugs on internet
Plenty of space
Poor
Expensive room service and minibar - $7 for a small diet coke. Bring your own !
Decor rather dated - could do with redecoration in rooms and elevator lobby
Also noticed noise during night from street below - despite being on 16th floor - I guess this is same anywhere though as NYC genuinely ""never sleeps""
Tip
Ensure you know where hotel is before going. I printed off a Google map and it shows hotel on wrong side of the road. I also printed off the hotel address to give to the taxi driver who was unable to find it. We ended up driving round and round blocks. It is located next door to an Irish pub with a large Guinness glass feature on the wall outside.",2
"I discovered the Sofitel a couple of years ago when I fled the Algonquin (which is down the street) after just one night. (Warning - the rooms at the Algonquin bear no relation to the pictures on the Algonquin's website).
On this trip I was staying with relatives in New York when I was struck with the flu and decided to decamp to the Sofitel to recuperate. I will often book through Priceline, but with the flu I knew I was going to be confined to my room, so I did not want to take any chances on getting a bad hotel by bidding for an unknown property on Priceline. So I booked the Sofitel on Expedia.
Here are the things I like about the Sofitel.
Quiet - it is one of the quietest hotels I have stayed at anywhere. That is saying a lot for a city like New York. On both this stay and on my last stay, I felt like I was the only guest in the hotel and did not hear any street noise or any noise from the other rooms.
Window Treatments - great window treatments - you can block out all the light at night.
Room size - the rooms are very spacious for New York. (One of the reasons I checked out of the horrible Algonquin back when I first discovered the Sofitel a couple years ago is because of the shoebox size rooms there).
Bathroom - as many have commented, the Sofitel has very nice bathrooms. There is a lot of counter space to spread out toiletries and every room has both a separate shower and tub (which is becoming very hard to find in New York since the trend is just to have a large shower - not good if you like a bath).
Good lighting - there is more than adequate light to read and work.
Some complain that the rooms are bland. It is true that unlike some of the ""hip"" boutique hotels, there is no cutting edge design. But I would rather have comfort over cutting edge design and I find the rooms with the simple white duvets and clean lines to have a Zen-like serenity. (Some complain that you just get a duvet, with no top sheet. But that is exactly how I sleep at home since I find top sheets annoying - so chacun à son goût).
If you are looking for a hip, happening hotel, you probably won't like the Sofitel. I find it very sedate. That is a huge plus to me, but could be a minus to you.
Anyway back to this stay. Wasn't sure how long I was going to be sick, so booked two nights through Expedia. Got put on the 14th floor (floors 2-14 are the ""cheap"" floors) right near the elevator. Didn't matter - it was still dead quiet and I felt like the only guest in the hotel. The room was fine - spacious and sunny with a nice little view (helpful when you are spending your time in bed sick looking out the window). One minor quibble with the room - the flat screen tv is on the desk. There is still room to work at the desk, but if you really wanted a desk where you could spread out, you might be unhappy (not an issue for me because I was too sick to work, but just noting it for business travelers. If you have a really work intensive trip - book a suite - see below).
When I still had not recovered from the flu after two nights, I booked an additional three nights at the hotel. Expedia showed no availabiliy, but I was able to book directly (albeit at a higher price than through Expedia - I assume the hotel had higher occupancy on those nights and thus the rate was higher).
Although there was nothing wrong with my original room, when I decided to stay an additional three nights, I asked if I could be upgraded. They offered to put me on a higher floor - the rooms are the same, you are just higher up. I asked if they had something bigger. They offered a corner suite for $100 more a night. I hesitated, but then agreed and I am glad I did - best $300 I have ever spent. The suite was really lovely - a big window in the bedroom with a view of the Chrysler building - absolutely beautiful at night. A very large sitting room with another big window, a comfy couch and chair, a large desk (no tv on it - unlike in the regular rooms), a very attractive entry way and a walk in closet. Same bathroom as the original room, except in the suites the tubs are bigger. Made me feel a whole lot better about being sick to be in such a nice environment.
Room service - as you can imagine, being sick I made quite a bit of use of room service. Thankfully, unlike at some hotels, room service at the Sofitel operates 24 hours a day, although the after hours menu is quite limited. I find it amusing that people on this website complain about the price of room service at the Sofitel. It's like complaining about rain - it is just a fact of life that room service in a big city hotel is expensive. (And room service at the Sofitel is cheaper than at some other New York hotels such as the Grand Hyatt and the Royalton). Anyway, I didn't think the room service menu was very imaginative and the food was okay, but not great. Room service was prompt and everything was nicely plated. If you order tea, be sure to ask them to bring the hot water in a metal pourer rather than in the tea pot as the water will stay hot quite a bit longer even though the pourer is not as pretty as the tea pot. The Sofitel uses a good quality tea bag for their tea service. But It would have been much nicer to have loose leaf tea (which, alas, seems to be asking too much at 99.9% of hotels). (If you want loose leaf tea, however, you can get it next door to the Sofitel at the restaurant in the Iriquois Hotel).
One final word - avoid using the Sofitel's dry cleaner. They ruined a favorite knit top I gave them by shrinking it so it no longer fit. The hotel refunded my money for the dry cleaning, but that was small consolation for a ruined favorite article of clothing. And items that I gave to launder while not irrevocably ruined came back faded and stiff. They really need to improve the laundry service - avoid it at all costs.",2
"I stayed only one night, but the staff was wonderful. A bellman carried my bags to my room and down again. The valet parked my car and when I got it the next morning, the windows had been washed. He got a great tip and I hope he shared it with the evening valet. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet.",2
"I wemt there for lunch and had their corn cutlets, enchiladas and the Pau bhaiji sizzler. It tasted awesome, they use no msg at all....the owenrs are all health freaks (:)) and thierr masala chai was very authentic.I took notive of the fact that they cook everything fresh. So do not rush them as they dont use frozen stuff ans do not store sauces. Its all made fresh.I'm going back tomorrow!",2
"Stayed here over MLK weekend and the place was sold out. But you wouldn't know it from the level of service they provided. The check in was fast, the bellman was ready and friendly, the housekeeping was excellent . I suggest everyone to join their loyalty club (Omni select) so you get lots of free extras such as wifi, bottled water, coffee and newspaper, nightly cookies n milk and a kids backpack filled with goodies. My hubby (who travels a lot for work in the company's dime) thinks this is an excellent hotel chain. I love how I have nearly nothing to complain about (except walls are a bit thin).",2
"An excellent movie and true story well worthy of your collection
This is another great movie and truly worthy of your collections especially on Blu-ray and as always I love true stories.. and it reminds me of The Godfather in some areas because it is very tense especially when they make eye contact with each other.. because you know that something is going to happen to someone somewhere somehow you just don't know when... excellent movie",2

"This was a great option - close to train and bus (directly across the street), close to lots of great stuff. The suite was super clean and nicely appointed. The breakfast was Fantastic! Tons of options to choose from, and the staff was great! (In particular, there was a woman from Serbia who was the friendliest hotel staff person I have Ever met!!)
One complete Stumper - the towels were TERRIBLE!! I mean, unbelievably bad! I have Dish Rags that are thicker and more comfortable! These were about as thick as t-shirts, only scratchy and somewhat thinner! What's up with that??!
Other ding - while they are trying to be more 'green', they still do things like run an entire dishwasher cycle for one mug and a coffee pot - No Need for that. And, time to put soap and shampoo dispensers in to stop throwing away tons of soap every day.
Otherwise, Great place. Would definitely stay again!",2

"Everything about this place was wonderful. The staff is incredibly hospitable, and upon learning it was our first time visiting, we were given a friendly welcome and a brief overview of what there was to look at. It seems nothing was really off limits, so there wasn't much intimidation walking about and there are nice places to sit and look at the animals at just about every section. The petting zoo was great and the goats weren't at all aggressive. All of the animals seemed very friendly and well-fed, snacking on fresh fruit and just lounging around. We were followed around the whole place by two ducklings and it was a great time. Highly recommend paying a visit!",2
I got a Groupon for this and have tried two classes at this studio so far - Sumits Yoga & Sumits Flow.

The motion sensing works well too, not overly sensitive to pick up say leaves blowing around, but snaps right on when I get into range.",2

"Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached Bollywood from an outsider's perspective. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however takes a different tack. It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness.It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with this same premise?) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well  the fish out of water meets duty-to-one's-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to reach self-affirmation.You couldn't have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show. Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan) performing. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie. Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other. So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own, the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case it's blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star, emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitles.Also synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today. The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film  in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold pattern.As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart  one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter. She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengths.Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is old school Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed  or relieved! It's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English lines.With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore.",2

The real selling point of this hotel is the price, and its excellent location - right off Union Square. It's a short walk from the hotel to restaurants, shopping centers, the Moscone Centre and the cable cars.

Initially planned to dine elsewhere but the kids started to throw tantrum due to the growling tummies, I had to change the plan and brought them to Nexus Bangsar South. The moment their eyes gleaming upon the fight of Edo Ichi, I knew that I could not escape anymore. So I brought them in.. ordered for them to cure their hunger while waiting for her to finish and walk over. ◾Atsuyaki Tamago - finished instantly upon serving. ◾Sashimi Moriawase - price ranges from 2-digits to 3-digits depending on the number of varieties and type of sashimi. I was craving for otoro and salmon belly. ◾Unagi Crispy Roll - crispy nori enveloping the rice roll with the flavourful Unagi at the centre and lastly drizzled with Japanese mayo... Can't get better than that. ◾Salmon Oyako Don with Ikura - requested by the sonny as he would order this everytime. ◾Saba shioyaki - prefer this style over teriyaki◾Ebi Tempura - very tasty snacks◾Foie Gras Avocado Steak with teriyaki sauce and assorted mushrooms - just because she was craving for foie gras at that point of time. We headed back home with stuffed tummies not long after that.",2
"Great service, incredibly fast delivery.
That's what I needed",2
Perfect so far.,2
"Great new, clean and fresh hotel in SOHO (opened Spring 2011). Yes the rooms are small – but this is New York – everything is small.
Try to book online through the “Plan Ahead & Receive up to 15% Off” special. This option via website reservations claims that if you book online 21 days or more prior to arrival you can receive up to 15% off your stay (offer is fully pre-paid and non-refundable). However see if your dates (even if you are booking less than this time frame) are still available for this deal – typically the website does not enforce 21 days in advance for booking this rate if the hotel is not full, so if your dates are firm and this option is available book it. (We booked this rate one week in advance of our hotel stay – great deal).
My husband and I reserved a Standard room (which is very small at 170-190 sq. ft. with either a Queen or King bed) but we requested a room on a high floor through our online reservation “Special Requests” field, and when we checked-in they gave us a room on the 18th Floor which we believe was a Superior room (slightly larger at 205-220 sq. ft. and we had a King bed). So the lesson learnt is to request a room on a high floor as your only reservation request. We didn’t mind the small rooms offered at the Mondrian SOHO since (1) its NYC and you don’t really spend that much time in your hotel room; (2) the hotel is really new and fresh and clean, and the room décor is white which make its appear not-so-small, and the Bathroom is surprisingly large compared to the size of the room; (3) the room was well laid out with a good amount of storage for your belongings for a small room; and (4) the views were fantastic from our floor to ceiling window.
The hotel has several common area terraces, so take advantage and sit outside – most hotel guests do not use them so it’s like you have your own private outdoor patio.
Entrances to the hotel on both Crosby & Lafayette Street’s - great location with walking distance to all of SOHO, and access to several subway lines.",2
"I have been regretting for not having learnt to swim as kid , but realized it's never too late . I have been taking swimming lessons since the past three months at Gold medal swim school and they are absolutely amazing. The instructors are so talented; they have tried and tested all possible methods to make it easier for the amateurs. My instructor Matt is a down to earth guy and he actually cares for his students. . The other instructors are equally cool too, however the majority of my lessons were taught by Matt \n\nTrust me, swimming lessons get me all animated after a day's long work. :)",2
"Boyfriend and I were craving a banana split and we decided to check this place out. Id have to say the best banana split I've had. The custard was so delicious! I agree that some of their \""creations\"" seem a little too crazy (I like simply delicious) so I think I'll create my own next time ! But that banana split was so good! \n\nI think my only complaint would be service we stood in like for about 20-25 minutes with only a few people in front of us. Maybe because there was only one employee? Thankfully we got there when we did because there was a line of over ten people behind us. The lady working wasn't very friendly either. But I didn't really care, I was there for the custard",2

My wife and I went for our first dinner as a married couple. The food was amazing. We had the tasting menu and it was to die for. The service was perfect Ed was our server and did a great job.

I called Cartwright on a Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Was told that the sales people were all busy someone would call me back. Sure enough George called me and we spoke for a while about the vehicle. George was more than willing to answer all my questions. I was coming from Phoenix AZ and wanted as much info as possible before deciding to fly to Vegas for a look at the vehicle. I asked if I did fly up if I could take the vehicle to an independent auto shop to take a look at it and George had no problem with that at all. The vehicle checked out very well and I went back to Cartwright and spoke more in depth with George. After a little friendly negotiation we arrived on a price I asked them to gas up the car and they put new windshield wipers on it. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND CARTWRIGHT MOTORS TO ANYONE.,2
Excellent food and service. Beautifully presented. Recommend private rooms for business meetings. Nice ambiance.,2

"I was quite unimpressed by my stay the Palace Hotel this May, especially after staying at the new Intercontinental San Francisco the two prior nights. The problems started even before we entered the hotel. We walked to the hotel after returning our rental car with my wife pushing our 6 month hold son in a stroller and me lugging a carry-on, a 26"" rolling suitcase, and carrying a large backpack/baby carrier. As we came up the ramp at the entrance, NO ONE came to our aid to either help with the bags or even open the front door. We were directed to the front desk by the bellhop, who also offered zero assistance.
The front desk clerk was nice enough. I inquired about upgrading our priceline booking with starwood points and he mentioned there the only availabe upgrade was from the superior to a deluxe and that was not much of a difference. He looked into getting us a ""courtesy upgrade"", which I knew should be offered anyway for a SPG Preferred Plus member.
Then as I left the front desk, without receiving directions to the main elevator, wandered around the lobby for a bit before finally finding it.
Yes, the lobby and dining room is very opulent and grand, but that was about the only nice thing about the hotel.
We finally got to our room on the 8th floor facing the adjacent hotel. Everything just looks old, from the wooden door, to the dated furniture. I guess some people would consider this classic, but I much rather prefer the modern furnishings of the Intercontinental SF. As with many of the hotels we checked in at this week, the room was quite warm when we entered. I guess everybody is trying to save energy and have motion activated thermostat controls.
The bed is so far the worst of our stay so far in SF. Very springy with average linens, three small pillows. The bathroom had a nice marble counter, which is all I can say good about it.
I guess the age of the building limited the number and placement of the electrical plugs because they were on the floor and not so easy to find.
The ceilings were quite high as others have stated. Oh, and somebody finally opened the main entrance door for us when we returned from dinner...too little too late though.
We will definitely not be staying here again.",2
i don t feel like being clever,2
"Great rooms, free breakfast offering in lovely atmosphere. Right in the heart of the city. Ask for room on higher floors to avoid city street noise. Parking a bit high $26/night, but you can park a little cheaper next door. Great location, free bus right on the corner.

"I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. To say that he encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what he does well...and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver. Sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't ""get"" the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks his life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the ""wrong"" choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it doesn't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But 10 out of 10...no the movie doesn't reach that excellence.",2

Sooooo good!!! If you must be gluten free like myself this place has great options. Enchiladas tamales rice beans and a few others that are nearly impossible to find! Definitely try the enchiladas Christmas style and a beef tamale.,2
Very unique and great food.,2
"We stayed here for my sister-in-law's wedding. The hotel keys didn't keep their magnetic memory, and we had to go to the front desk 3 times during our stay to get our keys recoded so we could get in our hotel room. Breakfast was expensive! They charged $10.95 per person for not much more than a continental breakfast. Room service was only offered for limited hours around dinner time. There was lots of room confusion upon checking in with the wedding rate, and I believe one couple was even placed in a room reserved and paid for by others not even associated with the wedding party. I only received cleaning services one day and on that day had to leave my room for them to clean it after having been gone for 6 hours earlier in the day. The 2nd day I was there, I was gone for 9 hours and my room still hadn't been cleaned by the time I got back. I will not be staying at this hotel again.",2
This was the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Everyone in the hotel were just superb. Service is top notch. Location is just 2 blocks from the White House. Room was huge. I was so impressed with the front desk (Mr Linnemann did a fine job). The hotel management should be extremely proud of their team.,2
"Generous rooms, great service, excellent location for train and metro. The perfect DC base for business.",2
"Perfectly suited to the splendid village feel that permeates through Thistle Street, Cafe Marlayne is surely as close as you can possibly get to a rustic French Bistro in Scotland. Tiny, with tables crammed together, barely legible hand-written menus, and a grumpy, garlic munching chef swigging wine from the bottle in the kitchen. It's all an illusion of course, and this carefree rustic charm is in fact carefully constructed with almost military precision, but in some ways that makes it more impressive.\n\nI get the impression the menu changes weekly or perhaps daily, but if the duck with apples is still on I can heartily recommend it. The food's not even all that expensive which comes as a pleasant surprise, and you get a basket of bread thrown in for free.\n\nOnly downside, that isn't a fault of the restaurant at all, is that there were some very irritating punters in on our visit. All had South East / Home Counties accents, and talked loudly and obnoxiously in tones that belied the arrogance, humourlessness, and lack of self-awareness that you would expect from them.\n\nIt was quite comical however, when the drunken trustafarians at the table next to us had their credit cards declined. I wouldn't fancy washing the dishes to pay the bill on a busy night like that.",2
Fast delivery & efficient service. Good prices are a nice bonus too,2

Been to Bonfyre twice. Both times it was full but not crowded. All in our groups had a great experience. The food was delicious.

"I have been a big fan of Mercurio's since the first time I visited. I'm surprised I didn't get to writing a review about it in the time I lived in PGH. Better later than never, I guess. Let's talk about Mercurio's in its latest location reincarnation. The quality of the gelato is superb, and I haven't disliked one flavour I've tried. Personally, I like the texture and the flavour punch of gelato better compared to its sister, ice cream. Some of my favourite flavours at Mercurio's are: lemon basil, chocolate hazelnut (Nutella), raspberry chocolate chip, and the dark stracciatella. Seriously, you can never go wrong with Mercurio's. The people that work there are super friendly too, and it's a family-run business. I'm glad they moved to this spot right on Walnut, but they have a lot of traffic during the hotter months no matter where they are located. Try it out if you're ever in the Eastside.",2
nice little cafe - does nice breakfasts (around 12ringitt) not quite as good as breakfast in UK but nice enough!!,2
"Jimmy D with Starz Entertainment did a fantastic job providing us DJ services for our wedding and reception. Jimmy D has a great and well-deserved reputation in the DJ community. We are lucky we were able to hire him to DJ our wedding and reception. He has many years of experience and it shows. He was energetic and super professional in every aspect of the planning and execution of our wedding and reception. He answered our emails immediately and met with us several times before the wedding to make sure we had everything set up the way we wanted. He spent hours before and after, setting up to make sure the lighting and sound was the best it could be. He had great suggestions for songs and activities and helped make our wedding and reception absolutely perfect. It was seamless, and everyone had a great time! We highly, highly, recommend Jimmy D and Starz Entertainment for DJ services!",2
"We stayed in this hotel and it was marvelous. When I walked in I thought I was in an upscale lounge. I had to wait for my husband, so I relaxed upstairs on the second floor overlooking the entrance. The couches were plush, clean and extremely comfortable. After we checked in, the bed we so cozy I didn't want to get up, but we were in Chicago, so we had to explore. The night before check out, the concierge printed our plane tickets and had them waiting for us in an envelope at the desk. They also had the best cucumber water I have ever tasted!",2
"Stayed here for 6 days last month on business. The hotel is beautiful and has a great location. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a king size room and thought it was kind of small, but very nice, clean and well maintained. There were a couple of nights that I stayed in after the meetings and ordered room service. The food arrived in a timely manner, was pretty tasty, reasonably priced for room service and the waitstaff was very polite. Overall, I was satisfied, but It would have been nice if they had a larger menu selection. I would say my biggest disappointment was in the television channels available. Since I did stay in my room a few nights, the lack of choices seemed very noticeable. I'm sure if you're with family and friends, there are enough channels for limited viewing. I would recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again in the future.",2
i feel like someone who does for others should be admired,2
This Marriott is within a corporate park next to a shopping area. I walked in was greeted and wisked through the check in process. It couldn't have been any easier. The hotel was clean and nice. If you walk out the back door there are shops and restaurants. It was perfect for our trip. The service was great!,2

"My sister and I booked a room at the Affinia Chicago through a package deal with Orbitz. We had stayed at another Affinia property in New York City and were very pleased, so we felt confident that we would have another great stay at this Affinia. We booked a guest room with one bed, but were very happy when we were offered a double bed room at check-in. The room had a small entry area with a minibar, desk and bathroom (with some crazy orange metallic wallpaper!); with the 2 beds 3 steps down from the entry area. It had a nice sized closet with robes, an iron and ironing board, hairdryer and a safe. The bedroom area had a full-length mirror and a decent sized flatscreen TV.
The minibar refrigerator was full of soft drinks, juices and some alcoholic beverages, but we just wanted to use it to keep some of our own things cold. We asked at the front desk and were told that it was OK to take the things out of the refrigerator as long as we replaced them before leaving. This worked out well, and we were able to eat breakfast in the room.
The Affinia beds are some of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. We were on the 19th floor, and we had none of the noise problems that others have mentioned in their reviews. I heard a couple of sirens, but we were never awakened by sirens, or any other street noise, for that matter.
The staff at the Affinia is very friendly and helpful. The concierge printed out our boarding passes for us, and we got some restaurant recommendations from the desk clerks. We didn't try the restaurant, but we went up to the bar just to check it out, and it would be a great place to relax in the evening, but we were too exhausted to take advantage of it.
Chicago is a beautiful city. We particularly enjoyed the Chicago Architecture river cruise and the art deco walking tour. We traveled all over by bus, and found step-by-step directions on www. transitchicago. com. For something off the beaten path, take a trip to the Graceland Cemetery for some unbelievably beautiful grave markers - you can even buy a book at the Chicago Architecture Foundation that gives you maps and pictures of the more famous ones. We had a wonderful lunch next to the window on the 95th floor of the Hancock Building, and some great desserts at Grand Lux, not far from the hotel.
We enjoyed our stay at the Affinia Chicago, and would definitely stay there again.",2

This was my first time staying here but it will not be the last. it was a great room and very quite for the location of the hotel. the staf was the best at any hotel i have ever stayed.,2
"This is a nice hotel, and if one could give fractions of stars I would probably give it 3.5, or so. On the plus side, it is conveniently located, the beds are comfortable, and the place seems to have been recently renovated. There is a complimentary happy hour and there are cookies later in the evening. The staff is pleasant. So far, do good...
On the other hand, the building is somewhat undistinguished and the lobby is kind of small and cramped. The breakfast buffet is so-so. They have an omelet bar, but very few customers seem to use it as there is an additional cost. Heck, Embassy Suites includes omelets in their buffet. Some of the details in the guest room bathrooms seem a bit cheesy. But these are minor quibbles
While I wouldn't choose this as a vacation hotel (just not memorable enough), I would not hesitate to return as a business traveler.",2
"My husband and I stayed at the hotel over the Fourth of July weekend. The hotel had an European accent and it was just right for both of us. The manager, who I later found out was the owner, she even called to make sure we arrived safely. The hotel's location was perfect because it was absolutely ideal for all of the quadrants of the city. We got to our destination on a bus or on a trolley. I really like the hotel. I would definitely come back anytime.",2
"Un mois après notre retour, quelle ne fut pas notre surprise d'apprendre par notre banque que notre carte bleue avait été utilisée au Mexique au mois de mai. Nous avons immédiatement pensé à l'empreinte de carte bleue laissée en caution à l'hôtel à l'arrivée, mais nous n'avons pas de preuve ! Il semble que d'autres personnes aient évoqué le même problème dans cet hôtel.
Insistez pour récupérer l'empreinte de votre carte bleue. Nous l'avons fait, mais nous n'avons pas assez insisté par politesse.",2
"Very good meal along with very good service. We sat on their patio which faces Camelback Mtn., a beautiful spot. The popover bread thing was good and innovative. We split the cowboy rib-eye. It was delicious and enough for the date split. Our waiter recommended both the tuna appy and the peanut butter mousse dessert. Both were great. Spent a deuce total with a $60 bottle of wine. Fun night.",2
"Just returned home from a 5 day stay with my 3 young adult sons. We were lucky to get an online special from the hotel for the Mediterranean Suite overlooking the Chicago river. Two of my sons loved sleeping in the window seats that are actually twin beds. The room had some pretty funky decor, and was very spacious and immaculately clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge and bell boys. Location was ideal, midway between the loop district and magnificent mile, with great theater and shopping a stone's throw away. We enjoyed the afternoon free wine hour. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.",2

No where else can you go and have a personal mixologist, in a private setting, and in Las Vegas, or anywhere! \nI can't really begin to decribe every single detail in this place. The thought that went into it is incredible. Everywhere you look you see something else to appreciate. I don't want to spoil anything. So all I can say is trust the reviews! \nI also have to give a shout out to the talented piano player that played for us, Spidoni (I hope I got that right). He is there on Wed night only. Great guy and plays beautifully. \nOne last thing. I would definitely recommend going early. There are very few seats anyway, but my husband and I sure enjoyed having Dan, just about all to ourselves!\nTruly the BEST experience and can't wait to return!",2
Very delicious with big portion sizes. Worth every ringgit. A bit disappointed they don't have poutine anymore,2
"I loved the the film. it beautifully analyzes Italian petty bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed. For instance, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth.For a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy no one in the book shops knew about the film. a great pity.The one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on about, does the film no harm.",2

"I have seen the recent Region 2 DVD of this movie displayed in the ""horror"" section in an Oxford Street store and also advertised as a ""classic thriller"". In reality it is almost solely a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades.Perhaps his incessantly cheerful, exuberant and essentially good-natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much British comedy of the past twenty five years. However there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who frequently borrowed the ""self-strangulation"" gag that Arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with.There is a striking, rare appearance by the under-rated Linden Travers, who makes an impact as the mysterious Julie.",2

I have been at the top tier Solitaire PPS for a few years before the SQ program changed and my company changed travel policy. Needless to say I have spent many many hours on SQ at all levels of service. My 2 hour flight from Singapore to Bangkok on this day was nothing different. On time departure, a clean aircraft, good service and comfortable seats. What I have come to expect from SQ. However, I experienced something new on this flight and have not seen it again since. During meal service the cabin crew passed around a shared menu card for all of us to use across our row. How odd? The 2 meal selections were highlighted and explained with pictures. Just out of curiosity, I asked about this menu card because I had never seen it before and was told by the crew member it was only for shorter flights. I took a picture of the menu card and the crew member seemed a bit offended by that. I thought nothing more about it until after the meal service I was approached by the Flight Director and he asked me why i had taken a picture of the menu card. He made me feel as though I had committed an offence. It was a real issue with him. He made me very uncomfortable with this manner of approach in front of other passengers. I explained my reasons for taking the photo because I had never seen it before I I found it an odd thing for Singapore Airlines to do. To be honest, as I explained to the FD, this was not what I expected from a world class, award winning airline - my preferred airline. Anyway, this interest by the FD about why I had taken the photo made the menu card even more of an unusual experience. The FD provided the standard reply and that was the end of it. I am waiting to see if I am ever presented with the shared dinner menu again.",2
"I stopped by and took our some grilled fish and vegetables and was pleasantly surprised when I dug into the package.Even late at night, they provided very fresh fish with a big variety of vegetables in large portions and all of it cooked perfectly with no oiliness, MSG or other unwanted stuff we usually find in Western food in Ipoh.It's a bit pricey for Ipoh but the portion size may compensate for the premium. My local friend indicated that food prices here have increased a lot recently.The place was very lively for late Sunday night and customers seemed to be having a good time. Don't know about the beer or alcohol because we just ordered the food which was, thankfully, given to us speedily, then left with it.I'll definitely come back when I'm next in Ipoh.",2
"Its totally different from the strip (well not THAT much), dont expect the glamour of the venetian or wynn, but do expect great fun:\n-Visit the ultra-mini casino called La Bayou (they serve you drink faster then you can drink 'em... you will have them lined up on the side of your slot)\n-Buy a football beer (like $8 bucks) the 4 Queens have them.\n-Gamble cheap in any downtown casino, my fav: $1 roulette in the Plaza (some nights)\nHave fun!",2
"Great food, great beer prices, and great live music.\n\nI was in a band that played there a handful of times, it was always good fun... and I loved getting pierogies or haluski before the gig.\n\nNow we go just to enjoy the place & whatever else may be going on.",2

"We enjoyed the TOPAZ in April '04, and choose it after reading reviews here on tripadvisor. It was our first visit to D.C. It is a small Hotel, no fancy lobby or overall appearances, a small bar, but our room was wonderful. Very clean, cleverly decorated. The employees were always helpful whenever we spoke to them. Our reservation was made on line and there were no glitches. There is valet parking. If there was a disappointment it was the bar. We read it was a top spot and unusual, but we found it pretty ordinary, other then some not so ordinary decorating. Also, the subway wasn't too far away either. If you like this area of D.C., and just want a nice room by all means, great place. Smith and Lewinsky's Steak House nearby, and 5 star dining at the Mayflower Hotel!! If your driving, catch N street off Connecticut, the one way streets are a challenge for a first timer.",2

"Breeze specializes in flights out of secondary markets, like my home airport of Richmond. I would probably fly them just for the direct flights to the west; being able to go directly to Arizona without needing to connect is a gamechanger. The flight times are also convenient as well - unlike JetBlue, which showed its disdain for Richmond by scheduling its (since canceled) flight from Richmond to LA at 9 PM, Breeze schedules its west coast flights so that they leave east coast mid-morning and get back before it's too late at night. But what I really like is that upgrading to their Nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable - maybe $100 each way. The ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes Breeze a winning proposition. There are some things they could do better - there's no wifi or IFE on the plane, and the flights only run twice a week, so it's not always possible to use Breeze if your schedule doesn't match up. But I hope these are growing pains that they will resolve as they continue to grow and become more successful.",2

"In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. When the wagon train is near to their destination, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take an attitude.""Wagon Master"" is another great western of John Ford. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the group of Mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Caravana dos Bravos"" (""Caravan of the Braves"")",2

"I came here for a celebration with my coworkers and it's good to know such a yummy place existed close to work! I'm usually biased when it comes to Hibachi. I love Geisha House Steak and Sushi but I think Ohjah is equally fabulous.\n\n They both have combination deals for their Hibachi meals. The Geisha has one for $35.95 which includes choice of appetizer, small sake, house wine, or soft drink, soup and salad, hibachi shrimp, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, bean sprouts and fried rice. It also comes with fillet Mignon, chicken and lobster. Ohjah's deal starts at $8.95 for the basics which come with onion soup, salad, fried rice, steamed rice or noodles. Then you can choose the type of meat. My choices were fillet Mignon, shrimp and scallops. My meal was around $32.95. The fillet was nice and tender, scallops were so good they melted in your mouth. The shrimp and veggies were also delicious. I still prefer the rice at the Geisha but Ohjah's comes in a close second. The amount of food you get at Ohjah's is just right but at the Geisha you will have enough to take home because they have bigger portions.\n\nI also had their pomegranate sake which was served warm. This was the first time I tried warm sake and it was delightful! It had a mild taste which wasn't too sweet or bitter. \n\nLove this place and wouldn't mind coming back! The Hibachi show is also very entertaining especially if you order sake bombs. They say \""sake\"" you say \""bomb\"" while you pound on the table. I kind of felt like I was at a pep rally which is always fun !",2
Ads suck bit other than that it's pretty cool,2
"love staying here ...this place is the bomb! no matter which side north or south the views are simply amazing.
this trip we took advantage of the spa. both of us had massages with kind and knowledgeable therapists: zoey and livius. thank you for taking such good care of us. we also used the gym, pool and shower rooms. our thanks to the wonderful staff. this area is super taken care of by very considerate people. everything is maintained, extremely clean and the amenities are fab: fresh fruit, lemon water, lavender towels, herbal tea, etc. etc.

"I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here during Labor Day weekend and Taste of Colorado. Only blocks from the event and the rest of downtown Denver. Now, as Platinum members of the IHG Priority Club, I know that the experience we had was probably different than a regular guest.
Early check-in; free welcome cocktails and an upgrade to a suite made the stay very comfy. I can imagine the regular guest rooms are quite cramped as my parents, who were also on the trip staying at the Hyatt, re-marked that the very first time they came to Denver they stayed at our hotel when it was a Holiday Inn.. in the late 1970s. So, imagine rooms with that vintage of footprint.
My chief complaint was the elevators. They required you to slide a room key to use. Bonus. I like safety in urban hotels. Downside? They required a card slide for every floor button pressed, and that often meant people were missing their floors, and getting sent up and down trying to get to their floor... which also meant that elevators were hard to get up on the 25th floor.
I'll definitely give this property serious consideration on return visits to Denver.",2
Just a bit over priced for Malaysia but food is great,2

"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store. I wondered to myself if this was the same film until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely Kristine DeBell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories. Subversive Video, to their credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As it turns out, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X in spite of the original XXX advertising at the there. Seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's scope behind the camera, in his salad days he directed two episodes of TV's DEATH VALLEY DAYS.Miss DeBell, appearing in the April, 1976 cover of Playboy is ideal as Alice. She brings a fresh all American innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life. When her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a 'musical comedy' yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid, given the genre and the supporting cast of Wonderland are there to enable Alice as she blossoms into womanhood. Special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an appointment.or something.Special features include comments from noted feminist advocate Lena Ramone who imparts how viewing this movie while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduation.What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a delightful jaunt is its garden like setting. Partly filmed in the lush, natural splendor of Vancouver B.C.'s Stanley Park, the movie belies its pornographic roots. You don't come away feeling you've watched a sleazy skin flick. At this writing, I haven't viewed the triple XXX version. The extra sex footage tacked on afterward would, in all probability, disrupt the overall flow and remove the light, breezy atmosphere evident throughout.Naturally, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore Alice's adventures in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule representing 1970s' adult film archives, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth following that white rabbit for a ribald ride full of mirthful mayhem.",2

"First off, I must say A. McKinnon either is not reading this series, or cannot see the humor in the Halle Puma series. This one was short, which is my only complaint. This series is adorable, charming, enertaining and sexy. Light, fluffy fun which does not warrant a long, overly wordy and dull review. Got a couple of free hours and want some fun? Read Sweet Dreams!",2
"This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed. The book by Rebecca West was written in 1918, soon after WWI, when shell shock and trauma-induced amnesia were not clichés, as the reviewers call it many books and movies later. It is difficult to go back in time and live, as the characters lived, the realities of the time: the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas, the British class system the wife thought all-important, the hopeless spinster, and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago.Alan Bates as the amnesiac soldier who ""will die"" if he isn't allowed to see Margaret, the girl of his youthful dreams, builds on the devotion his character showed in ""Far From the Madding Crowd"". Having seen that performance, it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn't live up to the family's and society's expectations. Margaret says, ""We quarreled, and as you rowed away, you turned your face away from me."" So we know that the breakup was something that he instigated, that it brought him shame, but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with Margaret. I haven't seen all his films, but in the ones I've seen, he imparts a strong masculinity, which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier.I didn't even recognize Ann-Margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated. Not having read the book, I wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between Jenny and Chris, though Jenny does state that she ""is a cousin"". The way Kitty keeps Jenny in the nursery in the hair-drying scene, the fact that Kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for Kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun, or sentiment about a lost child, and the statement she made that she wished Chris hadn't felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child. Also, Jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role, as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time.Having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover (non-sexualin keeping with the mores of the time) from 50 years ago, I couldrelate to Margaret's and her husband's dilemma. I, too, was cast aside because I wasn't good enough for his family, and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet, I was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying Vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved. My husband, like Margaret's was very understanding, but the strain was very real. The lover was finally able to reconcile his real-life situation with his fantasy of loving only me.I thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in Chris's mind. I thought of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" with the WWI soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus Chris's joy in his fantasy of Margaret. In contrast, the actiona of the soldier in ""Mrs. Dalloway"" seems overwrought.Showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to Chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced. Everyone seems to get their life back, but was it the right choice?",2
"This is a must-do if you are in Downtown Vegas. I also recommend doing it at night when the street is lit up! We made a reservation (highly recommended) and then did a little drinking and gambling until our time. Now, a reservation doesn't guarantee you go at that specific time, just that you do not have to wait in the line once you get up to the zip line area. Once we arrived at that area, we waited about 10 minutes to harness up and then about 5 minutes to actually go. However, if we didn't make a reservation we would have had to wait in a line where it was first come, first serve between reservations.\nAnyway, the guys who put on my gear were very nice and polite. At no point did I feel uncomfortable. I felt the harness was very secure and felt as if they did a good job of securing me in. Once we were geared up and ready to go, the guys did a final safety check and we were off!\nNow, the ride is short and the takes less than a minute, but it is totally worth it! It's a unique feeling to be zip lining above a crowd of people! Once we were done, the guys unhooked us and we were on our way! \nWe decided to purchase some pictures to commemorate the night with because it is definitely an experience!",2

"If you are looking for a basic, reasonably priced hotel in DC, this is a gem. It is clean and well maintained, and the rooms are comfortable, large, and very functional. The staff were friendly and helpful. And if being close to Union Station (or the Postal Museum) is important to you, this is the place to stay. And there is an Irish restaurant/pub in the hotel that is a great place for a pint of Guinness or some hearty pub food. The Phoenix Park is not a luxury hotel, but neither do they have luxury rates. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable, friendly, and reasonably priced hotel, this is a great choice.",2

"Three of us stayed in this hotel in early march, we were pleasantly surprised, the room was a fair size for 3 people and the bathroom was not as small as i expected having seeing other reviews, the staff were very pleasant and accommodating, including the maids etc. The location was excellent, we would stay here again, the only gripe is the restuarant McCormicks & Schmicks, this was a disaster, we ordered 3 soups, only 2 came out first and it was cold,we also had to ask for spoons, these were dirty. while in the process of trying to return the 2 soups, the dinners were brought out, one of our party was still waiting on soup, the chef brought back the dinners, one dinner then came out 15 mins later, the waitress brought this one out on her sleeves, still no knife and forks, the manager eventually came over , we didnt pay, i have never returned food in a restuarant before, but this was really bad, maybe we were just unlucky. The next evening we went to an italian restuarant - Maggianos, go there, the food, service were excellent.",2

"I have to be honest, i was expecting a failure so bad, because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But that wasn't the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny. The jacuzzi bubble, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to Video and DVD movie. While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works. 8 out of 10",2

"We have stayed at the Hudson twice for day trips into the New York to go to the Metropolitan Opera. We were looking for an affordable hotel near the opera for this trip. So in my mind the pluses were the location because we were able to walk to the opera, the parking garage is near by and the bakery on the corner is great for breakfast. I also like the Malin & Goetz toiletries in the bathroom. The downside of the hotel is that the rooms are small and dark but I think that is probably normal in NYC unless you pay a lot for your room. For some reason the hotel is always hot when we got into our room the heat was cranked to 80 degrees. It was a little too hot for my taste. The other thing I didn't like is that nothing is really marked, while I understand that it might be hip and cool it can be difficult to navigate the hotel unless given directions or reading the brochure in your room. However, for our second stay it wasn't an issue because we already learned where everything was. The lobby can be noisy at night but we never had trouble sleeping. The beds are OK. I have slept on worse but I have also slept on better. On our first stay the hotel held our bags for us after check out which was nice because we still wanted to spend some time in the city after check out.",2

"I agree with ""Jerry."" It's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many good low-budget ones AREN'T underrated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not ""rip-off"") of 2001, because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man, who had somehow been turned into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect his ""mind"", but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When the Christopher Cary character, who can't find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there's a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all.",2

"What is the problem with all the negative reviews?? Yes I read them, but was it really THAT bad? Our stay was wonderful, yes, it's a typical city hotel, with sirens, noise, cars, planes, and the typical commotion one would get staying smack in the center. Check in was very quick and friendly, lines were about 6 deep, and they moved swiftly. Elevators were fast and very busy. We were staying during Army Navy weekend, and the hotel was 100% full, and the elevators were constantly full, however staying on the 20th floor gave us absolutely no elevator noise, problems or waits. Our room was very nice, new comforter on King bed, very clean, nice view towards Rocky Balboas famous steps... ice bucket and glasses, water to purchase, large TV, normal bath amenities, curved shower rod, and lots of thick towels. We never needed to request a thing. Coffee cart in lobby in the am, courteous staff all around, and a great stay. Would definitely stay again.",2

"I have never been to an animal shelter that didn't make me feel terribly depressed, angry, and, well, dirty. That is, until I visited this shelter. Of course, I was still pretty bummed after we left, but I certainly felt a lot better than I normally would after a visit to a shelter.\n\nThis place is incredible. The units are cleverly and beautifully designed, well-landscaped, and energy efficient ( <url> I noticed employees taking special care of the newcomers, as they seemed to be very concerned with how they were adjusting to the new (hopefully very temporary) digs. \n\nWe went with a friend of mine once, who decided on a very tiny Chihuahua mix. I was very pleased when they scheduled him for their open clinic, where he received free care and a prescription for a little infection he had in his eye. Fixed him right up in a jiffy.\n\nI'm so impressed with this place. I never before imagined a \""feel-good\"" animal shelter.",2
"Peer review assessments in this kind of course, with more complexity, are a little bit annoying. Someone reviewed my essay (1 introduction + 3 body paragraphs + conclusion) saying stuff about my 5 body paragraphs, showing that she has not even understood what a body paragraph was. This same girl also noticed lots of punctuation mistakes in my essay, while others evaluated it as almost perfect. I know it is kind of complicated to teachers and mentors review the essays, but this model is a bit frustrating. :/ Other than that, the course was just amazing! I loved the videos, the format, the quizzes and games really helped me to learn, and the proposed essays were nice. Thanks!!",2

"Being unfamiliar with hotels in Seattle, we simply chose the Paramount because of its proximity to the Paramount Theater where we were to attend a concert. It was also more moderately priced than many of the other fine hotels nearby. We were greeted at the check-in desk as though they were sincerely happy to have us as guests, and the service from every person we encountered was the same throughout our stay. The hotel is very tastefully decorated, immaculate, and our room was lovely. The Paramount is conveniently located close to the monorail, making easy access and a short ride to many of the points of interest most want to see when they're in Seattle. It is one hotel that I can, without hesitation, recommend to anyone.",2
"片言な英語に不安があったのでホテル日航にしましたが、フロントもレストランも日本語は使えませんでした。
客室係に電話して日本語の対応をお願いしたら、日本人スタッフがcall backしてくれました。でも、ついでにホテルのサービスについて質問しても要領得なかったので、バックオフィスの方のようでした。いざという時に日本語でコミュニケーションできるだけでも有難いでが、ちょっと期待外れでした。

"Not only do they do a fantastic selection of locally grown produce, fresh baked goods, plants, holistic household items, and gardening supplies, they have meat and game for sale and recently installed a butcher upstairs and have extended the caf\u00e9 downstairs.Wholesome salads, quiches, interesting sandwiches and an array of teas and coffees make this a caf\u00e9/shop worth the trip out to EH9. \nWe sat outside in the sunshine enjoying a fantastic platter of marinated lamb, cheeses, Baba Ganoush, Hummous, Salads, peas and new potatoes. It came with freshly baked flatbreads and crispy crackers too. Even though we consumed large amounts of food I still felt rather virtuous and healthy as it was all so fresh and tasty. Our friend had a Beetroot and Goats cheese tart which was also amazing and very reasonable at \u00a37.95. The platter retails at \u00a312.95 and was more than enough for two. \nDespite the extensive and fantastic cake selection we opted for strawberries and fresh cream with a brownie on the side of course! The brownie was perfectly gooey and lovely, yum.\nAll in all a wonderful lunch and a great shop! Earthy watch out - when I move to Newington next week you will be sick of the sight of me!",2
"I have flown this airline a few times from LAX to Japan & Korea, as well as to Bali, Indonesia. I have always enjoyed the kind and friendly service (the flight attendants are so beautiful and handsome and have the best uniforms), and the personal entertainment systems are great (good selection of movies and screens have HD clarity). Food is decent, with both western and Asian fare (I found the Asian food to taste better), plus we were always given hot cloths for refreshing and plenty of water to keep hydrated. My favorite Asian airline, so far.",2

"The Hotel was very new and the people who work there are extremely nice! It is out of all the chaos of time square and in my opinion the best food in new york was Greenwich Village/SoHo. The Hotel was perfectly nestled in a quiet part of SoHo. The hotel was very small only about 6 rooms per floor. It did not have a pool but did have a small fitness center that has everything to keep up with your workout routine. There was no resturant just a bar with over priced snacks but not even the a block away has bleecher street which has the best pizza in new york. So food should not be an issue. The last thing is that the hotel is one of the cleanest I have ever been in and each room comes with a large TV , and free wifi as well a desktop computers in the lobby. This hotel was by far worth the money and stay i highly recomend it.",2
"Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to watch. I'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film. I simply wish to congratulate this small film with the GREAT BIG HEART. I tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast. If you want to know what happens in the film...then go see it. Michael Parness, writer/director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter , Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career ahead for Mr. Parness. This film works. Right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with every movie, we need to suspend some disbelief, yet I found with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transported and completely convinced with it's ""surreal moments"". I only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has ""pulled"" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For instance Guillermo Díaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving. The colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr Olympiad, as a terrified patient...perfect. I can go on and on...This independent feature has the star power of a big budget Hollywood film however, you forget about the STARS on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant screenplay. I look forward to seeing more from Writer/Director Michael Parness.",2

"This was our first stay at the Chandler Inn and we were quite pleased with the cost.
The staff was friendly, the room was clean. The location was in a very quiet neighborhood in close proximity to the T station.
We wanted a very basic (i.e., inexpensive) place to have while we were out sight-seeing. That being said, the bathroom was smaller than my closet at home and the furniture looked to be from Ikea. As long as you aren't looking for luxury, then this was a very nice place to stay. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",2
"My fiance and I stayed here the night of the NYC marathon. Though the location was nice, we can't say too much about the service, and the rooms were very small (we had a full-size bed for the 2 of us - needless to say I didn't have room to stretch out after running 26.2 miles). The hotel was very busy as a group appeared to be staying there from the marathon, but as there are only 3 very small elevators, I waited for 15 minutes for an elevator, but as everyone was full that came by, I was forced to use the stairs after running the marathon. At checkout the desk clerk took a phone call while I was trying to check out, completely ignoring me, though he'd already begun checking me out, and after my male fiance came over, he completely stopped acknowledging my (a female's) presence and addressed all statements to him, even though I was the one who initiated the check-out.",2
"Shahrukh Khan and Yash Chopra films have never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect to watch. Mohabbatein remains as one of my favorite movies ever. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies, but definitely worth a watch. And SRK, who blew me away with an excellent performance in Baazigar, repeats a villain act. And this time he gets an experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol to support him.Before I comment on the acting, it is not just the acting, but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch. It is the writing that compliments the great acting. The story is gripping, but the characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes along well. But the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much. The viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of yawns. But the movie is still good.Shahrukh Khan is brilliant in his author backed role. Shahrukh Khan once again is sympathetic and cruel. You are bound to cry at the end. Juhi Chawla is decent. Her screams are bound to become annoying after a while. But in facial expression she is excellent. But her ending scene she is brilliant (though she was overshadowed by SRK). She has an author backed role that makes her very likable. Sunny Deol is adequate. His character was very likable, but too perfect. And it gets boring after a while. He does a good job though. Anupam Kher is really funny, but his role felt a little out of place. Tanvi Azmi supports well. The songs are enjoyable and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and presentation is very 90's film like. Tu Mere Saamne (You are in Front of Me) and Likha Hai (Written Here) are nice love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is a decent love song also. The instrumental song is danced to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song Solah Button. The movie may not be perfect, but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it.",2
"ogni marriott ha il suo prezzo, invito quindi tutti quelli che hanno dato giudizi negativi a questo hotel tre stelle, a chiedersi come mai e' quello piu' economico pur essendo in una posizione perfetta. Le camere sono normali, in america ho visto hotel molto piu' cari con camere minuscole da non poterti muovere. E' un hotel molto datato e si vede, ma ha i comfort necessari per trascorrere qualche notte. La doccia e' grossa e il bagno ha lo spazio necessario per muoversi. I receptionist sono educati e sorridenti e sempre pronti a darti un buon consiglio. L unica pecca ,imperdonabile e' la porta comunicante tra le camere. La prima notte avevamo ,nella camera accanto, una famiglia di pazzi che urlavano e litigavano...hanno continuato fino alle 3 del mattino. Riassumendo, e' un vecchio hotel con tutti i servizi ""basic"" ,un' ottima posizione e un prezzo accessibile. Se cercate l'eleganza non andate a questo marriott.",2

"My usual preference is small boutique hotels but it was very difficult to find a bargain towards the July 4 holiday and was able to booked through Hotwire. I found the hotel's Facebook profile and posted the days and occasion I was arriving for and asked for a room with a view and perhaps some comp. When I arrived to my surpise a few things happened, I got a big warm welcome and a large modern room with an awesome lake view, next day I came back to be greeted by ice cold beers, tidbits and birthday wishes, never have I received such good hospitality from any hotel, I am truly converted but doubt that any other mainstream brand hotel would provide such personalize care. Tips: become a Gold Passport member for late checkout, the Stay Fit gym, Bockwinkle's on Stetson, rotissiere chicken open till midnight and Lou Malnati's deepdish in River North.",2

"I stayed at this hotel with friends for 5 nights in December 2006. The room was spacious and clean. We were fortunate to have a room overlooking the pool, these rooms are quiet and removed from the sounds of 42nd street. The hotel is in a wonderful location less then 10 minutes walk away from Times Square, and 5 minutes from the nearest subway station (take a subway map as routes are poorly marked).
We had breakfast at the Diner next door to the hotel, and as I was on holiday I was able to order the banana pancakes without the usual guilt. We also enjoyed some meals at the Theatre Row Diner conveniently located close to the hotel (across the road and left). For a drink head to the Lansdowne Road (from the hotel - left down 10th Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets), a friendly pub, with fabulous staff, only minutes from the hotel.

"Education was beneficial to my everyday life. I help but revert back to the lessons taught when it comes to my diet, and the little ones that run around our house.

I would suggest this course to anyone, and though it may seem easy. The diagrams and lessons will stick with you through every meal.",2
"Tire wear seems to be a hidden secret Arizona Tax. The construction materials on the road always seem to either find your windshield or tires. Plus the high temperatures seem to lessen the life of your tires; buying tires that are rated for 40,000 miles seems to always come out to 30,000 miles or less.\n\nSo after a recent episode where my tire basically almost ripped in half, I went to Discount Tire to get a replacement. You know the drill, they go out and measure all of your tires for wear and tear and recommend whether or not you need new tires elsewhere.\n\nIt turned out that I needed another tire. But the \""tire guy\"" said \""hey, let me see if the manufacturer will take this tire back since it looked to be defective\"". So long story short, the manufacturer took back the tire and I saved a cool $200. \n\nPro tip - always buy the replacement insurance on your tires. I can probably count more than 5 tires that have gone flat and/or super nova in the last 3 years on all my cars. That move has saved me a ton of dough.",2
"This was our first stay in NYC as a family (3 kids ages 6 to 12 years) and LOVED this hotel. The room was beautifully appointed with all sorts of electronic gadgets, including automatic curtain closers which the kids loved (along with the TV screen built into the bathroom mirror and the amazing fish tank in the lobby). The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the room was spotless. However, Room 504 faced the street and was drafty and a bit noisy; the windows are original, single pane windows. Got a great deal thru Hotwire.",2
"You simply cannot beat this place. Bang for your buck at its finest with some of best noodle dishes I've ever had. The dumplings are to die for. The Pork Potstickers were so moist and flavorful, best dumplings around. This is a staple for us at least once a month. Be aware that when you dine in there is usually a wait on the weekends and the restaurant does tend to get packed in fast. So we tend to go early or go with their quick pick up. The best part of this place is that everything noodle wise is made in house. You can watch the cooks making the noodles, and when you have them you can really taste the difference. A well priced one of a kind restaurant.",2

"After another hotel in the neighborhood lost my reservation that was made four months in advance on their own website, I was forced to scramble the day before my July 12th flight to find another place to stay. Given the reviews I read here, I called the Hotel Carlton and was absolutely blown away by how well I was treated. The timing was too close to send me an email confirmation, but the reservation agent made sure I had the name of the desk manager who assured me that my reservation was all in order. When I checked in, I was treated as though I had been a long term client who booked ages in advance. I was given a great corner room that was quiet and had a great view. The room was bright, comfortable and charming.
The location of the hotel was perfectly suited to my needs and it was nice to have a little restaurant in the same building that served breakfast, even though there were plenty of other restaurants nearby to choose from. The focus on service was exhibited by every staff member I encountered, from the bellman to the restaurant staff, the maids and front desk people. I even got a personal response from Theo McKinney, the Guest Experience Manager, as a follow up to my post-stay Satisfaction Survey. These folks exemplify the meaning of ""hospitality.""

"We booked our stay at the Fairmont Heritage Place based on Trip Advisor reviews and as Fairmont President's Club Member - I had read about the venue. We wanted to create a very special trip for our family friends who were visiting from Canada, so we went all out. The place was fantastic in almost every way. The pre-trip concierge service was amazing - everything that I requested was perfect. They went out of their way. The welcome was top notch. we were greated in the room with Champagne and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries for our friends Anniversary - a wow for sure. The suite was gorgeous - two bedroom on the 3rd floor. Exquisite design, great kitchen with everything you need. Nice tvs, sound systems, DVDs etc. The daily breakfast was plus - everything was fresh and yummy. The complimentry car service was a plus - we barely used our car. The $50 a day valet was not so nice but typical for the city. The only things that prevented me from giving it a 5 star rating was that there was a heap of dust behind the master bedroom bed and all of the fixtures in the bathroom were really dusty - I am not THAT picky but for the $$$ this could have been taken care of. The other issue was that in rooms that back on to North Point Road are crazy noisy - I had to pull out ear plugs or there was no sleeping - I let the concierge know about both things - but he was not that phased by it??? No service recovery whatsoever - hmmm - That was not 5 star - Regardless I will come back to this venue with hope that these areas have improved",2
"Normally, I wouldn't stay in a hotel of this type as it's regular rate would be too expensive for me, but since I received a discount for a business trip, I was able to stay here. While I'm sure it's not as luxurious as the best hotels in the world, it was far above the average hotel. Such a beautiful interior lobby with its koi pond and garden, exceptionally friendly staff who were knowledgeable about the area, all of them said hello to you in any part of the building. Underground nearby parking was convenient, area of town (Japantown) was clean and you felt safe. Computers and a printer/copier for business were available, hotel bar was very, very nice, food was terrific. Can't say enough nice things about this place. The one and only criticism I could think of would be that while our room was very quiet for sleeping, a couple of times the AC unit kicked in and was loud enough to wake me up, but I'm a light sleeper. My partner slept right through it. Everything else was wonderful and I would definitely stay there again if I got the chance.",2

Staff was friendly, but not overly forced and chipper if you know what I mean.

"I stayed at this Westin for one night while tagging along on my boyfriends business meeting. We usually stay at Westins at this is definitely one of the nicer ones we have stayed at.
The location can be pretty easy to miss due to construction but its fantastic (great for shopping) I forgot a pair of heels and the concierge directed us to Nordstrom just a few blocks away (and mapped it out for us) She said there was a Macy's and Filene's Basement in the opposite direction but I believe that was a few blocks further. The concierge also made a recommendation for a great Italian restaurant within walking distance (Coco Pazo) and made reservations for us as well. She's friendly but a little too chatty...
The lobby is open to the restaurant/bar but the entire area gives off a trendy vibe. Check-in was quick, everyone was friendly and within just a few minutes we were in our suite.
The suite (I forget which kind) was large - a wetbar area, living room/office, with seperate bedroom, and a huge bathroom.
The entry way/wetbar had a wall of mirrors that led into the living room. There was ample seating (3 person couch, chair) flat panel tv, desk with Mac desktop and the room was so large it didnt feel cramped.
The bedroom had a Kind bed, flat panel tv, seperate sitting area with chaise lounge and was still very roomy. The bedroom closet had more than enough hangers (I'm a stickler about this)
The bathroom was HUGE - seperate stand shower, tub, but i do with there was a bit more counter space. There was more than enough towels in the bathroom and two bathrobes too.
I absolutely love this Westin and hope we stay here again next time we're in Chicago!",2
"My husband and I had dinner here this evening and it was Fantastic. We split a rack of baby back ribs and a Greek salad. The ribs were smoky, tender and just had an overall great flavor. They bring you a sweet sauce and a spicy. I had the sweet, which had a little bit of a kick too it. Really tasty. My husband had the spicy and loved it. The owners are super nice, ensuring we had everything we needed and our waitress was very attentive as well. On the way out I couldn't resist getting their oatmeal coconut cookies. Wow! It is so nice to have a family run business close by that serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Great job, Tennessee Grill! We'll see you soon!",2

"This hotel aspires to be a premium property, and the lobby and hallways have that flavor. But there is less there than meets the eye. The beds are just so-so. The climate control in meeting rooms is terrible. The housekeeping and room maintenace are problematic. There was something gooey on the floor of my bathroom and a non-working electrical outlet. Neither was tended to, despite promises from the front desk. The next day I picked up the city magazine in the room and found a huge piece of gum stuck to the bottom. In addition, there are signs of wear, including badly stained grout in the sink and tub. I reported the smell of gas in the hallway. It turned out to be a chemical smell from a nearby factory, but no one got back to me to tell me. And when there was a mistake on my bill, instead of taking my word for the fact that my group had breakfast coupons (I had one to show them), I was made to stand at the desk while the clerk leafed through all the previous day's breakfast receipts. And then our group's master billing seemed to fall through--our credit cards were charged instead. This hotel needs a major managerial and physical upgrading.",2

Although they do have pre-made breakfast burritos, did not try them so no comment on that.\n\nCoffee/Drinks: Always get the same thing and they always make it just right. A \""Cherry Blossom Tea Latte\"" hot with an extra scoop of powder and no foam.\n\nWifi: Yes! It's free!\n\nAtmosphere: You will be surrounded by college students from across the way (UNLV), attorneys trying to do some work and getting a cup of coffee right before heading to work and casual meetings between people.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this coffee bean because it is busy around the clock and I love people watching when I am not focused on my projects that I finish while on my mac computer.",2

"Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! \n\nP.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover.",2
Friendly user and show price in the front.,2
I am flying FDH-DUS regularly and I am fully satisfied with this airline. Due to the smaller sizes of their aircraft's the flight takes some time (about 1hr 15 min) but service onboard is excellent. Good regional snacks and plenty of drinks are served during the flight. Ground handling in FDH is very quick and efficient. Prices are high but still recommendable!,2
"Been to many of the buffets at Las Vegas, but this was by far the largest I've ever been too! So many selections and all the food was top of the line. Being from Texas I'm a hard judge on BBQ and this place held it's own! The brisket was smoked and juicy and the short ribs were to die for! Word of advice get small portions so you can try a little bit of everything, they have fresh made to order street tacos that were incredible! Overall wonderful experience and upscale environment. It's a must do when coming to Vegas!",2

"I first saw this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" when it first appeared on television. I actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations. I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" I consider this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a superb cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can someone be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? Scott does so easily. The direction is marvelous with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time, place and era depicted. You will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.",2

"DO NOT STAY AT THE SHOREHAM!! booked a deluxe luxury queen for 455/night + tax, 3 nights. room had a double bed. we complained 3 separate times. they said it would do no good to change rooms cuz all the ""queens"" are the same. did not sleep for 3 nights. NOT VERY CONSIDERATE OR SERVICE ORIENTED! night before we are leaving they sent a note admitting we were sleeping in a double bed--so they would take $100 off the entire bill. not acceptable!! if we had known it was a double we would never have booked at this hotel! went on line to look up room rates at the Shoreham for a double bed room. they do not list doubles as an option, only queens and kings. BE WARNED!!",2

"Stayed at the Columbus Motor Inn for 3 nights. We stayed in the 2 bedroom room. In the bedroom there was 1 double bed, dresser, and TV and closet. In the othe room (there was no door to this room so there is no privacy) there was 2 double beds. There is a TV, dresser, and a small table with chairs to sit at in this room. There is also a coffee maker located in the room. The bathroom is decent sized. The sink is separated from the toilet/shower. The room is OK in general. It was clean and there was daily maid service. We got facing Columbus and at night it was pretty loud --- between buses, cars, trucks it was noisy. The room could definitely use some upgrading and modernizing. But, given the price we paid it is a good value and decent place to stay. The best thing about this hotel is the free parking! It would be nice if they offered a continental breakfast, but that isn't a big deal. Free internet access is also very nice.
The hotel is located about a 5 minute walk to the Powell Mason Cable Car turntable. I recommed buying a 3 day pass if you will be using the SF Muni trasit as it only costs $18. A one day pass costs $11. A one way ticket on the cable car is $5!!! So, a definite savings is to get one of the passes. Also, the number 30 bus stops right in front of the hotel and that goes up to China Town and Union Square. Also very convenient and the passes are good for the buses too.
Fisherman's Wharf is about a 10 minute walk away. There is also a Safeway and Walgreens within 10 minutes walk.",2

"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh.""Just Before Dawn"" is noticeably more ambitious, ""arty"", and intelligent than some slasher films. Lieberman actually fleshes out the characters - well, two of them, anyway - as much as a 90-minute-long film will allow him. The film has genuine moments of suspense and tension, and actually refrains from graphic gore, save for one killing right at the beginning.There is an above-average cast here, including Oscar winner George Kennedy, as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, future Brian De Palma regular Gregg Henry, blonde lead Deborah Benson (it's too bad she hasn't become a more well-known performer, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour (""Ghoulies""), Mike Kellin (""Sleepaway Camp""), and Jamie Rose (""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown"") round out the cast.Some of the shots are interesting, and the early music score by Brad Feidel (now best known for his ""Terminator"" theme) is haunting and atmospheric.This is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark, although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical; it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon! One of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer, which I'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again.I didn't give it 10 out of 10 because I can't honestly that I was that frightened. Still, it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re-discovery.""That deed don't mean nothing, son. Those mountains can't read.""9/10",2

I was able to pick up my clothes the next day at the bell hop desk. All pieces of clothes were folded nicely and smelt great!

"Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife, he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide. Too bad for him our rumpled detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), is on the case.Stephen Bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, following marvelous detail with marvelous detail. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely engrossed. Then when Columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better.We first see Columbo after the murder (as per usual). This time he's at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show (think Columbo's discomfort over the nude model in ""Suitable for Framing""). Columbo is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non-suspects. Bochco, by contrast, shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to Columbo's quest to give the dog a name. As far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk makes the most of them. He's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he's even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with Cassavetes. That these two long-time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected; and that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted Columbo, even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When Columbo goes to question Benedict's snooty mechanic, of course  of course!  he asks the man to look at his own beat-up heap. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal, of course  of course!  he's on the piano playing ""Chopsticks."" And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller.Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely Blythe Danner, who plays Cassavetes's wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy show up as Danner's mother, though she does little with her minor role.The director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, most notably as Coach in ""Cheers"") does a perfectly creditable job, though he follows the lead of nearly every other ""Columbo"" director by adding one or two silly flourishes. Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus. Then there's that bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoom-in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There's also one scene with Myrna Loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes.These are quibbles, though. This is a splendidly entertaining episode, the kind that made me a ""Columbo"" fan.",2
"After reading some of the reviews , I was a little apprehensive about staying at the hotel but I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The staff was very cordial and they went out of their way to resolve my concerns. I had a problem with the safe in the room, but it was fixed promptly. They gave me the information when I needed to contact the Hilton Honors customer service staff. The driver of the van was on time, pleasant and courteous. From that experience on the van to the door of my departure, I had an excellent experience with the staff. The decor needs to be updated but the room interior was clean and fresh. A great shower ensured me that I would get a good night's sleep. My only regret was that I was busy in meetings and did not have time to enjoy the view.It would have been wonderful to sit and watch airplanes taking

"The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.Coburn's gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is a lot. For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your film.",2

You betcha. \n\nI'm not a big reviewer of chains nor have I ever done a mobile review (I'm big on length), but as a very regular customer here it almost hurts my feelings when I see it getting slammed as I check in. I come in and order to go, I get delivered to my house (all hours) and get it delivered to my office.... I think this gives me some insight. \n\nThey have never messed up my order (knock on wood). Repeat, never messed up. Trust me, I'm not a \""uhhh just give me the number 1 however it comes\"" type of person. I am an annoying special order person, even when I mix it up. I'm not sure what more you could want from a chain delivery sandwich place but what you ordered, in a timely manner. It's also clean in there & everyone is friendly. Again, never messed up my order... That's all that really matters LBH. \n\nProtip: if you want a sandwich for lunch, don't expect lightening fast delivery. This is a jam packed business dense area.

"A very comfortable and impeccably clean boutique hotel. Spent a week there in early March. Close to Times Square, Macy's and public transport. The beds are very comfortable as many other reviewers have noted. If small rooms are a concern, I would opt for the Contemporary Queen - not the Petite. It was great having a Starbucks attached to the hotel - quick way to grab a coffee and muffin in the morning. Highly recommend.
I should mention that room prices have already increased considerably since March - I would say by at least a hundred dollars (unless I just got lucky reserving through Expedia).",2
Im not even sure where to begin on this one. This was the best dining experience of my life. And yes it was a dining experience. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. Not to mention perfectly attentive. The duck fat fries were the perfect start to the night which got better with the king fish sashimi (huge chunks of fresh fish with jalapenos!) and the lobster grilled cheese with tomato soup (more lobster would have been appreciated). After that we sampled the bread (saving room for entrees) and were very impressed by its light texture (must have been the potato flour). I had the ribeye cap (BEST STEAK EVER) and my husband had the tapioca crusted snapper (he loved it). I would highly recommend getting the ribeye cap as it is a cut of meat you cant find elsewhere and you dont even have to work to eat it -- there is no fat to cut off! It is all the flavor of the ribeye without any work! :) \nThe wine list was great. I really appreciated the range of bottle price ($28-2008) and was even happier when the waiter didnt scoff at my choice of a $42 bottle. \nFor dessert we had the beinets with the vahlrona pot de creme and it was perfect. FYI: the beniets tasted great reheated the next morning so dont be afraid to get them to go.,2
"Always fancied this film from the video cover. Eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film. A simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully. Even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is, as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale. It's really moving, frequently amusing and very watchable. Not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout. A 9/10 from me. A must see.",2
"It is a great pleasure to be reading The New Yorker on a weekly basis, having it always on demand and not having to fumble around with a paper magazine is great. I have been an occasional The New Yorker reader since 1989 but only in hardcopy and never a subscriber, living the past 3 years in Switzerland I told my wife, once we lived in the US again I would get a subscription.It is strange to read reviews damming kindle for charging Usd 6 (in round numbers) monthly for the magazine, since they can have it in hardcopy for less.Well I am sorry the quality writing for 6 bucks a month and delivered seamlessly through the air, what is there not to like? I would have no issue paying Usd 7 weekly for the magazine that would be one dollar a day.Kindle rocks, and we should all be willing to pay for quality.

"Took my family for a weekend trip to San Francisco. The St. Francis is a beautiful old hotel in the heart of San Francisco on Union Square. Most of San Francisco's tourist attractions are within walking distance or a short cab ride. Our room was located in the historic older part of the hotel and was nicely furnished and clean. Hotel staff was friendly. The only complaint we have was the long wait for elevators, which was due to the fact the hotel was extremely busy. We would definitely stay here again.",2

"Lot's have already pointed out the many great things about KO's but here are a few more. \n1. They have fun and unique events. Like King Kamehameha birthday, where they had a Hawaiian themed party. White Trash Night, $1 PBR's and Schlitz. On Kentucky Derby day they have Mint Julep's and other fun drink specials. Not to mention the St. Patrick's day blow out. \n2. The food is very good as many people have mentioned, but my favorite thing on the menu is Harold's Green Chile and eggs. I love this dish for breakfast with fresh tortillas and black beans. Awesome! \n3. If you live in one of the many apartment communities in the vicinity they have a free shuttle back and forth to your front door. That is very handy , and the driver John is a heck of a nice guy and a great driver. \nOh, and one more thing about the shuttle bus. Great name. \""The Lord's Temple\"" they bought it from a church. What once was a shuttle hauling the faithful to Sunday school now carries drunks home safely. What could be better than that?",2

Went through Expedia, got an amazing deal and loved the place. It's close to everything, we walked to dinner and took a short cab ride to the show. The next day we walked about 10 minutes and were at the monuments and Smithsonian. The room was clean, the guy at the front desk was more than helpful to get us oriented and couldn't have been nicer. ill be going back for sure. oh, and morning breakfast room service was amazing.",2

"This restaurant was a wonderful find! Great food, great service, very good value. I really enjoyed Kayra's food which tasted authentic and was obviously cooked with much love and care. The seafood is very fresh and because it is so fresh you must expect to pay a little more. But having said that the food is still very reasonably priced. The Koonthal Pera (squid cooked dry with grated coconuts) was a winner. So too was the Kerala spicy shredded chicken. However, the best dish of the night had to be the Meen Curry. Will I return? 100% sure I will. And if you haven't tried Kayra yet, you should.",2

Additionally, the assignments are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion. The instructors videos are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking!

Check in was quick and friendly without being fake and my room was on small side but everything was in good order. it was my bday that weekend so received champers & strawberries which I thought was a nice touch.
The gym is open 24/7 which is great for people like myself and the club next door was kicking.

"My wife and I spent this past weekend at the hotel for our anniversary. It really was an awesome experience from the time we checked in till, unfortunately the time we had to leave.
On the first day, the hotel accommodated our request to check-in early. We were warmly greeted by Cole Kelly, the Guest Relations Manager, who escorted us up to our Suite. Let me just say that Cole is probably the nicest and warmest Hotel manager that we've ever encountered. I was in communication w/ her leading up to the trip and she helped w/ every detail. We opted for a ""Level Nine"" suite, which she lead us to and explained all of the amenities that comes with it. If you can splurge a bit, I highly recommend getting a room on the 9th floor. You have your own lounge, nightly appetizers and cocktails, privacy, complimentary fruit and non-alcoholic drinks.
The rooms were amazing as well. Yes, they are small, but it's what I expected from a boutique hotel in the District. Our room had a balcony that overlooked Dupont Circle and it was relaxing to sit out there and watch the hustle and bustle below. We had a King Canopy bed, nice soaking tub and walk in shower all encased in marble. It was very luxurious.
The first evening, we had a very late dinner reservation. We decided to go to the 5pm appetizer and cocktail hour in the Level Nine lounge. The apps were awesome and the drinks were very good and strong :) We had a very nice chat w/ Cole who hosts the event.
The location of the hotel is great, very close to the Dupont City Metro, about 2 blocks. There are a ton of restaurants and little shops all around and on Sunday there is an amazing Farmers Market about a block away.
The only real negative I can say is that there is only one elevator to the 9th floor. If it's busy, you're going to be waiting a while for that elevator. It's really not a big deal, but just allow extra time if you're running a bit late for something.
All in all, this place was wonderful. The hotel itself is amazing, but having Cole there makes it all that more special. Thanks again for a great anniversary.",2

"Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show.I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways, although i'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series.Early episodes were fun, good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate disciplining the kids, however i think the show lost it's sparkle when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died, i felt the programme did to. To me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the '8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the Hennessey dad.Bridget seemed to get more annoying, Rory stayed the same and Cate was always giving her offspring life's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to Paul. I think the Granddad is funny (Especially when he's watching Great escape) but feel C.J is unnecessary to the show. He is funny in parts but I felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. Over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate works at the school and C.J and Granddad's always there too? I would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for Paul and Kerry, but later ones were about average at best.",2

"Beautiful Hotel at Seaport that is close to a lot of new fancy resturants such as Legal Seafoods, LTK, and Temazcal with great views of the water.
Rooms are comfortable with added details such as Keurig coffee machine, heated mirrors in the bathroom, Bose alarm clock, and free WiFi. Beds are comfortable and rooms have great views of the port. Room service food is very good and delivery is very on point.
A well equiped gym and a decent sized pool. The hotel also has bikes to rent so you can explore the neighborhood. Make sure to walk down seaport to Yankee Lobster and get their lobster plate or NE lobster roll. It's delicious.
Tip: The hotel charges for bottled water inside the room, however, there is a free beverage area in the gym with lemon or strawberry water, orange juice, and milk in the refrigerator that are free of charge.",2
"Managed to get a VERY cost effective fare - at least half the price of a comparable Air NZ flight. Everything was impeccable on this trip - except the check in people who didnt seem very interested in doing their job (not Singapore Airlines issue - as the staff are all contract and swap between airlines) and the outdated entertainment system. Staff service was fabulous, food very edible and luggage allowance very generous. For the price there is no doubt this warrants a 5 star rating.",2

"Stayed here in February 09, been meaning to write this review for a while. Seriously dont bother booking anywhere else unless you are one of these fancy Plaza dwelling rich folk! This hotel is lovely, we booked a double room and upon arrival were upgraded to a suite free of charge! Huge bloody great suite with walk in wardrobes, yeah its a bit outdated re: decor but how long you staying indoors when you are in the big apple? $4 for breakfast...v cheap in my opinion. Less than 5 mins walk from central park and you could spit into the subway from the lobby! well u know what i mean! The staff were fantastic and the doormen were STARS!! ** they booked our return cars to the airport and recommended restaurants when we needed them. Superb location. You know what im already booked up and am going back with my fiance on the 3rd of September this year for another week. Of course there are going to be people who are gonna find something wrong with this place, thats the human in us all but try to take no notice of the neg comments here! Just look at the 5 star ratings compared with the one stars and you'll know what i mean. Dont forget to take a taxi to and fro to the airport DO NOT BOOK A SHUTTLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!! BEWARE THE SHUTTLE SERVICE!!!!! have fun in NYC and definately book with the Salisbury!",2
"das Sheraton ist optimal im Zentrum von Seattle gelegen, Man kann alle Sehenswürdikeiten und zum Hafen, wie auch Shopping zu Fuss machen. Parken ist wie überall dirket in der City mit 28 Dollar nicht ganz preiswert. Das Hotel hat Wireless in der Lobby frei und wenn man ein Zimmer in den oberen Stockwerken hat, eine super Aussicht. Hotelbar angenehm und der Poolbereich für ein STadthotel super. Die Zimmer sind überdurchschnittlich gut ausgestattet. Ein Tipp geht unbedingt zu BIERSCH zwei STrassen weiter in einer kleinen Mall gelegen im obersten Stockwerk zum Burger essen. Ist ein Ableger einer deutschen Brauerei.",2
"This is located about 1-2 blocks from the Space Needle and I think what they call the Science Center with various museums as well as one end of their monorail.
Good things: Off street parking (not secured), very efficient checking, AND one of the better free breakfast services for a hotel. I gotta chirp about the latter since I need a good breakfast. They have juice, coffee, and milk. They have free waffles. They had free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Wow,..since when do you get free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. They also had cereal, yogurt, and fruit. They also had a small pool which wasn't good for much more than taking a dip to get the grime off after running around Seattle. Note: the mention of a restaurant only pertains to their free breakfast area.
Bad things: The carpets were a bit on the nasty side, especially in the hallways. They really need to replace them, though they're worn probably due to all the traffic. I think a lot of people stay here for the location to the primary Seattle attractions at the needle and center. Kind of a cheap shower (though hot) and bathroom area though the beds were comfy enough.
All this said,..a bit over-priced, but I'd consider staying here again, mainly for the free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS.
Good location to the bigger Seattle attractions including the various pier areas (great seafood,.yum yum), the monorail to downtown (i.e., stay here, take a monorail to the city center is pretty cheap), Pike's place (you have to see this area; yum yum sea food, all kinds of shops, tons of beautiful people, the original Starbucks).
Note that the Seattle area can seem to be a bit seedy, however, do note that this is a BIG, port city so you have to expect this. Very safe during the days. I'd be a bit careful walking around at night though.",2
"Do not give this hotel your email address. I needed provide my office with a receipt, so when I was booking I specifically asked that my email was used ONLY for the the receipt... now I am overrun with spam hotel messages!

"Das ""Belverde"" liegt in ""theater district"" in der Nähe des ""times square"" ( 4 Gehminuten vom Hotel ). Das Gebäude des Belvedere ist das letzte, höhere Gebäude vor dem Hudson River. Das heißt, man hat aus den oberen Stockwerken einen tollen Ausblick ( auch auf die Kreuzfahrtterminals ). Das Hotel ist in 2010/2011 renoviert worden und bietet viel Komfort. Die Zimmer sind groß, sauber und zweckmäßig ausgestattet. Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich, ist aber bei Wünschen und Anfragen, die nicht das Hotel betreffen, ziemlich planlos. Die super Lage und der erschwingliche Preis ist aber Grund genug, um sich hier wieder einmal einzuchecken! Für einen Städtetrip genau das Richtige!!!",2
"Hubert Keller is one of my favorites from Top Chef, so I purchased a Restaurant.com gift certificate and made reservations via Open Table at 7:00 PM on a Monday night mentioning that we would be celebrating our anniversary while in Las Vegas.\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes early, but that was no problem and we were immediately seated. The hostess asked again if we were celebrating anything special and my husband told her it was our anniversary the next day. We were seated in the dinning room away from the walkway and bar so it was not too noisy. The decor is lovely, and I wanted to take home the water glasses because they were so pretty. It was very dark, but I guess you can say that it was romantic. There were a few other patrons and even a family with small children.\n\nI ordered a enjoyed a wonderful glass of sangria ($10), and we ordered the croque monsieur, lobster mac & cheese, sliders, and meatballs. Our server had suggested we order 3-4 selections each, but we decided to start with these four. Let me tell you, it was plenty! We were very full by the end. The croque monsieur ($9) (a grilled cheese sandwich with ham) was small, but was cut in two and we each had half. It was yummy, and I loved the mustard and little pickles. We could have easily each had our own it was so good. I thought the bowl of lobster mac & cheese ($18) was a rather large portion, and at any other restaurant I would have called that a meal for one. It was tasty, but I have to admit that I have had better elsewhere. There were only two black angus sliders with a few frites ($12). They were decent, but nothing to write home about and left me wanting more which didn't help when five tiny meatballs and a little bit of broccoli ($14) arrived. The last two items were a little bit disappointing given the price, though both were tasty and I would order them again.\n\nWe ordered two deserts-- the cheesecake with strawberries (such lovely presentation), and the affogatto (bailey's ice cream) made with liquid nitrogen tableside. I couldn't resist and both were absolutely delicious and watching our server make it was fun. We were also brought a little plate of some sort of chocolate moouse with kahlua foam (I think) with \""Happy Anniversary\"" written on the plate with chocolate syrup. What a nice touch and ending to the meal.\n\nI thought the amount of food was perfect, but three deserts was a little indulgent and one would have been plenty following the other four items. There was a little issue with the Restaurant.com certificate (our server accidentally charged the full amount and then the reduced amount), but said the original one would be reversed. After a few days the money returned to my account. None-the-less, it was a lovely pre-anniversary meal and we will definitely return on our next trip. We are already looking forward to another croque monsieur!",2

But its also that place that if you can spare the extra dough, you can enjoy a high quality meal at above market prices and still feel like you got a steal, knowing who is directing the flow of the food. Not that I believe for a second that Mr. T Keller is back in the kitchen directing the traffic, but his influence and high standards are felt everywhere and in every bite....\n\nFor as often as I make it to Vegas these days, I can spare that extra dough and have a meal that I will not easily forget...",2
"Amsterdam to Jakarta via Medan. The check in process was adequate, however it was more like a transaction rather than a check in as the person checking m in seemed bored. I note that Garuda use agents in Amsterdam rather than their own team. Garuda uses the KLM lounge in Amsterdam which is quit large, however it is mainly full from early morning until midday, therefore very difficult to find a seat. Therefore I went straight to the gate and waiting for boarding. We boarded on time, however the aircraft pulled back a little behind schedule, but that did not delay our arrival in Medan. Onboard the cabin crew started serving drinks as soon as we sat down and also took note of what I wanted after take off. The menu selection of food and drinks was quite good and the crew keep coming around offering snacks and drinks after main meal was served. The main meal which I chose was the COD and it tasted very good and was well presented. After arrival in Medan I was assisted through immigration and baggage collection. After clearing customs my baggage was taken by the ground staff for forwarding to the Jakarta flight. The Medan-Jakarta sector again was good as their was a selection of Asian and western food available for breakfast. Again the service onboard was very good. With the exception of the check in experience and lack of seating in the KLM Lounge in Amsterdam, overall it was an excellent flight with outstanding onboard service.",2

"Seriously? I am so disappointed i am the only one on here writing a review for this place. Because its the bomb! For food that is . . . . . So it looks like some crappy convenience store from the road, its got some heart and people hugging on the symbol (AMP) which doesn't give it a lot of street creds in my book. BUT THE FOOD IS AMAZING!! Or just really good authentic mexican. \n\nI consider myself a bit of a dive mexican restaurant snob (carolinas, los dos molinas, La tolteca, tacos jalisco, etc I work in south phx) So when i tell you this place is good, believe me it is worth a try. You got taco bell and about 5 other mexican restaurants in a 500 yard radius . . . . .and this place is more of a convenience store that just happens to have a hot kitchen in the place, but it is so good! You must try their Gorditas with steak! SO GOOD.\n\nThe majority of their customers come from TT Roadhouse (a dive bar 100 ft away). That is how we heard about it in the first place, we were checking out our local dive bar when I saw (and smelled) a girl eating take out. I wanted to know where she got it, and what it was. The rest is history. \n\nI gave this place a 5 stars only for the food taste, because it is a convenience store not somewhere where you will have date night. But friday night take out? Yes!",2

"""Scoop"" is easily Woody Allen's funniest film of the 2000's so far. Allen, although finally looking his age, is at the top of his game as low-brow magician Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and demeanor are hilarious. Don't let the critics sway your opinion. ""Scoop"" is a top notch ""Woody-Lite"" picture. The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen. Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit. Jackman is dashing. The cinematography glows. ""Scoop"" is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish. The last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price.",2

"Das Hotel Angeleno liegt zwar in Brentwood und Beverly Hills direkt um die Ecke, leider aber auch genau am sechsspurigen Freeway, der Tag und Nacht stark befahren ist. Unser Zimmer war eines der ruhigsten, aber an ein geöffnetes Fenster war kaum zu denken, wenn man sich noch in mormaler Lautstärke unterhalten wollte. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig, schön und modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Absolut einen Besuch wert ist das Restaurant mit Lounge""West"" im 17.Stock mit tollem Ausblicküber L.A. und gutem Essen. Zwar gibt es einen Pool, ist aber nicht wirklich zu empfehlen, da der Verkehrslärm wirklich störend ist. Parkplätze rund um das Hotel sind rar und zeitlich begrenzt auf 2 Stunden (zwischen 10 und 18 Uhr). Das Hotel verfügt über Parkplätze für 18$ proTag.",2
"""Pet Sematary"" succeeds on two major situations. First, it's a scary Horror movie. Those that just aren't produced in these days. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan. Probably, the best adaptation to any of King's novels. The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete Horror/Drama accomplishment. Stephen King's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title ""Pet Sematary"" does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere, now it turns very dark. The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life, and ""Pet Sematary"" proves it dramatically. The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. Sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much, much worse. What will happened with the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with the surreal nightmares? Watch ""Pet Sematary"" to witness one of the most touching, emotional Horror movies of recent times. You won't regret. The acting is very good although I didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father. He didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *Shivers*. Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.Something is for sure... I don't wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!",2

"We were supposed to origionally stay at the Best Western, Market Centre, but their a/c was broken down, so they relocated us to The Quality Inn for the same rate. We went to check in, and there was a little bit of confusion to why we were checking in there under Best Western. Once it got sorted out, we checked in our hotel room. We were a little surprised, as the hotel lobby was nice, but dated. The front desk people were really nice. All of the rooms' doors are on the outside, so you go from hot and muggy, into a nice air conditioned room. Right away, you can tell it was older. The way up to the room wasn't very clean, and the room itself was not too impressive. The walls are thin, and you can pretty much hear a conversation from outside, and people walking from the floor above. The hotel is overdue for renovations, but as for the customer service, I give that a 5 star. The free shuttle service to downtown is a bonus that we liked. Free continental breakfast was really good, with lots of choices - make your own waffles in the shape of the Texas state. Breads, yogurt, cereals.....juices...danishes. We had no idea what to do as tourists, and again, the front desk helped us beyond our expectations. We would stay there again, once it gets renovated. ; )",2

Once I started this book, there was no stopping. I couldn’t wait to find out what would happen next, especially with all the struggles and obstacles the characters faced. Wow.

"Fans of the HBO series ""Tales From the Crypt"" are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of ""making up,"" and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) But Abbey's never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.)Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.",2
"Absolutely LOOOVED this show. \n\nThe first Cirque show I had ever watched was O, so watching Zumanity was such a different experience. \n\nThe seating area is small and cozy, but still very spacious. I loved the cute little couch seating around. \n\nThe vibe of the whole show was great. I just loved how there was a lot of audience interaction. \n\nI love the fact that the creators of the show were able to take sex and express it in very beautiful and classy ways that people wouldn't normally expect. This show puts a great spin on nude dancing and makes it enjoyable to everyone in the audience. \n\nGreat show. \n\nTip: Don't go to the show if you're up tight or not an open-minded person.",2

"Went to SF for the first time with my husband for a conference which was held there.
We got the room for $140 via priceline. The hotel itself is in a great location, in the heart of downtown, close to Chinatown and steps from the BART (metro).
I was a little upset because when we called they told us that the only ways to get there from the airport were by taxi ($45) or supershuttle ($16/pp) a nd so we took a cab. Turned out, you can take the metro (which we did on the way back) for $5/pp. to the POWELL station which is a block away from the hotel.
The beds and the pillows are amazing, it is like floating on a cloud. I actually looked up the pillows brand to get some for my bedroom.
The coffee offered in the room is really good.
WARNING: parking at the hotel is $50 a day so try to find an alternative solution if you dont want to spend that much in parking.
TIP: internet is about $13 a day in the room or $4/15min in the busin ess center. Right across the street at ""Organic coffee"" you can use there computers of a lot cheaper or yours for $5 a day. Someone told me there was a SOny station across the street that was free butI did not see it.",2

"Amazing experience with this place. I had talked to Justin a majority of the time and he was awesome!! I had originally gone to a mechanic that was charging me $1500 to fix the issues I had with my car. I thought that I was being played just because I was a girl and seriously know nothing about cars and the cost of fixing issues with cars. I went to D & W because it was recommended to me and since the first time I talked to Justin I knew that he was honest and definitely reliable with his services. He ended up charging me less than half of what I was originally quoted and got my car back as if nothing ever was wrong with it. I am going to be taking my Honda back to this place forever now, so glad to know that there really are trustworthy and honest mechanics out there. Thank you Justin!!",2
"I LOVE the W hotel. All of the staff are so professional, and kind! I had everything I needed. It felt like I never had to lift a finger. The best part? the WET DECK! It is so peaceful up there! I've never seen such a beautiful pool on the roof top of a building. They also have the Luminous Envy Tanning Float free to their guests to use! There is also this spa on the 16th floor called bliss that will blow your mind! Amazing Amazing Amazing! I live in Dallas, but I will come to this hotel for a mini vacation over and over!",2
"The beauty of Shook! is you get to taste or order dishes from Japanese, Grill, Chinese and Italian kitchen. There are so many choices that you can choose from.

For ala carte, the signature dish ""Snow White Dancing Prawns"" is a must try. I quite like the ambience, very classy and elegant. I will definitely come back here again.",2

"My son and I stayed at this location for a couple nights in May. The parking was great, right out the front door and the lot was well lit. The room was very clean and was cleaned on time each day. The best thing about this hotel is its location. There is a CVS just off the parking lot. We were able to go there and get snacks and drinks without getting in the car. Very handy. Like other reviewers have said the hotel is on the smaller side. We didn’t find that a problem, in fact it meant less noise! We would stay there again when we are in the area.",2

I bought this for my husband who's 6'1 and he did not use the hip strap because it was too high up for him but the backpack still worked great for a 2 week trip. I wore it sometimes too when we switched backpacks since mine was heavier (of course). I wish the thin hip straps were wider and better like a true travel backpack. They hardly offered support.",2

The stylus works pretty good. Feels like holding a real pen. My main usage is for my clients to sign their name on square app. Try it on few drawing apps it's pretty smooth.

"Some places are pet free and then charge you for steam cleaning the room or disinfecting – or whatever it is they somehow forget is not free. These costs can be as much as the room rent.
Well… as a first time guest of the parent Kimpton chain, I checked at the front desk and asked someone who was walking their large dog out of the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised to learn that their pet policy has no hidden costs. So – thought I cannot swear to it, it looks legit. I will add that they understandably exclude pets from certain floors, because of some guest animal adversity. But whatever – seems like a great deal for pet owners who travel with them if you are looking for a boutique, higher end, place in a downtown location.
The room was superior. The bed and linen better than normal. The staff was very friendly and helpful. But for me, the best part was that it was three short blocks to PETCO Park for a Padres game.
Also, the location is very central to the Gaslamp quarter, where food and drink places abound.

"Not recommended.
First, my boyfried arranged, through the hotel concierge, for a meet and greet to pick us up at the airport, at the cost of $120. We were met, the driver went and checked his mail, then we walked across the parking ramp to his car. No curb side service. We were further appauled when we asked the doorman to arrange a car back to the airport, and the cost was only $35! This car picked us up and dropped us off at the door! We asked the concierge about the price difference, and were told that the meet and greet picked us up at the door at the airport. We told her he did not. She argued with us. We informed her that we were there, she was not, and well aware that we had to walk to his car.
Next, upon check in, my boyfriend asked about the champagne and strawberries he had arranged to be in our room. The lady that checked us in did not offer to verify they would be there, and stated there were 7 other guests with the same name that weekend. Upon arrival in our room, they were not there.
We wished to see some museums in the area but were concerned about them being open with the holiday weekend. We asked the concierge, and were told they would all be closed on Sunday and Monday. We asked the next day again, and were told they would all be open.
We ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning. $25 per person for a breakfast buffet. This is fine, but apparently it does not include clean juice glassess or ensure coffe in your cup. However, there were several staff members standing around talking rather than making sure the guests have full coffee cups.
The icing on the cake is the fact that my boyfriend emailed the hotel when we got back, letting them know of our unsatisfactory experiance. He never heard back from them!",2

"On our last afternoon while awaiting departure to SF airport, we took in the Happy Hour at The View Lounge. It is appreciated that any age can be present during this time frame, as the views from anywhere in this lounge are stunning and should be able to be enjoyed by young and old. However I am not sure the ""Happy Hour"" title should necessarily be used, as the break in prices applies only to well drinks; no wine specials, no martini specials, no food specials. I did feel that the wine pour was generous, so thank you. We ordered the humus and pita chips as well. Waiter did tell us they don't have a kitchen on this level so the food is prepared in downstairs kitchen and we might have a bit of extra wait for our food. I'm not so sure this needs to be addressed to the customer, seemed odd at the moment, though I understand where he was coming from. But if you are offering food on your menu in The View Lounge then there shouldn't be a reason to ""apologize"" beforehand. I would return there for the stunning views it offers but I certainly won't expect any break in prices. Perhaps more safe to say I might recommend to others but wouldn't go out of my way to recommend or rush to return there.",2

"It all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on Hickory Road, London. Concerned for her sister, who is the housekeeper there, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look into the matter. He agrees, but soon the stakes get higher when a girl, who had admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) of the thefts, is found murdered.""Hickory Dickory Dock"" is a solid brain exercise, without being as mind-numbingly complicated as ""One, Two, Buckle My Shoe"". Murder, theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, particularly the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has his funny moments (in perhaps the closest this series has come to ""toilet humor""), and Miss Lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual.

"I really like their breakfasts here! It's down the street from my university, yet I didn't find out about this place until recently. My friend asked if I wanted \""hot bagels\"" and my response was that I love hot bagels more than cold ones. Little did I know that this little joint that seats only about 15 people inside and maybe 5 more outside got such great business and had such yummy food!\n\nI've been here about 4 times now, and I usually get the breakfast sandwich special that comes with a bagel sandwich (my choice of bagel, cheese, egg, and meat) along with a drink (fountain, coffee, or OJ) for only $3! It's a great deal for when I want to eat on a budget. I've had a blueberry bagel w blueberry cream cheese, wheat bagel and onion bagel sandwiches. They also serve boar's head deli meat. Yummy! =)",2

"Stayed here one night on Points.
Hotel is renovated and is very nice. Check in was a breeze and ample parking. There is a chilis and a couple of other restaurant options right in the same area.
Room was large with separate sitting area, with desk, and small mini kitchenette (microwave and fridge, sink, counterspace, coffee maker).
Double beds are okay. Bathroom is a bit oddly setup with toilet/tub in seperate room and sink/vanity in common area,but it works.
Breakfast was good with ample choices (fruit, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, waffles, etc etc).
This place is a bit far out from Downtown and the airport but I still recommend it.",2
"Decided it was probably time for me to review Sidebar, especially in light of the fact that I went there twice in one day. Yes it was embarrassing, yes they remembered me, and no I didn't care.\n\nWhy? Because Sidebar is the shit. Has totally become my fave neighborhood spot. Great seedy feeling bar, even though the decor is gorgeous and the bathrooms were spotless. I love feeling like I'm in a place where I could easily get into a bit of trouble, the good kind, and Sidebar gives delivers every time. Also love the fact that they feature works by some great local artists on their walls. So great that I thought Sunny B. was going to steal a painting this weekend, but that's another story for another day : )\n\nSidebar evokes a nice laid back, sultry vibe, thanks to it's cozy quarters, dim lighting, plentiful couches, and soulful music. They have a DJ spinning there on the weekends which leads to an impromptu dance floor in the middle of the place every time. Great place to relax with friends, throw back a couple drinks and chat. Music isn't so loud you have to shout, which is always a plus. Almost forgot to mention the fact that they are open until 2am 7 days a week!!!!\n\nThey feature a GREAT selection of beers as the reviewers who came before me have said, and easily the nicest bar staff I have encountered since I moved to downtown PHX. Gotta give a little extra love to Will G. who takes exquisite care of me every time I'm there. \n\nThey also feature a few small apps there but I have yet to try any. With the sheer amount of times I've been in the past 2 weeks alone, it can't be long before I do.\n\nIf you haven't been, Sidebar is definitely a must visit. Tell your friends, just not too many ;)",2
"My husband and I had a great experience with Paper and Home. We feel lucky that we found them for all of our wedding paper needs. Brooke and Michael were great to work with and made our wedding planning much easier. They were able to create invitations better than what we envisioned.

Our wedding was out of state, so we had our programs, napkins, and thank you cards mailed to us. They followed up with us to make sure that we received everything before the wedding. We will definitely use them again for any other stationary needs. We highly recommend them!",2

"We stayed over Saturday night, and the total bill with tax was about $100. With free parking, that's a screaming bargain for this part of Chicago. I'd give it 3 stars without the location. The place is kind of old, and shows many signs of fix-up, repainting, etc. but it was clean, everything worked and we got a good night's sleep. Note about the free parking: there are 40 spots for 71 rooms, so check in early and leave your car there. It's a cheap cab ride or easy walk (if the weather's nice) to Michigan Ave, or a short walk to the Red Line subway. We didn't eat in the cafe, there are way too many great restaurants in the neighborhood.",2
"The doubletree offered us a special deal including drinks, breakfast, and fourteen days of parking when we used it the night before our fourteen day cruise to Hawaii. They also had a free shuttle service to and from the port, but make sure you put your name in for it as soon as you get there, it books up fast. The breakfast was not very good, I have gotten better breakfasts at Best Westerns than here, but you can't beat the location, view, or ambiance of this hotel.",2
"This anime seriously rocked my socks. When the anime first opened itself, I felt it was too slow; the story wasn't quite moving forward, and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead. Once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together. It was fantastic.Additionally, I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop, in the real world. There wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on; the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on. A few of the ""surprise"" people that show up (Gilgamesh?) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn't have ""Generic Bad-ass A"" being replaced by ""Generic Bad-ass B"" as soon as A died.Anddd, I loved the music. The opening music rocked, and the finishing theme from the final episode just...Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Type-MOON!",2

The best part is the rooms, they are so comfy and spacious, the beds are huge and quite soft which I love. The rooms also feature seperate sink, bathroom and dressing areas which is great when travelling with someone else.",2
"Da Vang is 5-star food at traditional, 1-star prices. I've never spent more than $10 here, and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert.\n\nThe service is the best I've had at a Vietnamese place. Sure, there might be a pretty thick language barrier, but it's never gotten in the way of finding the perfect dish or having the order come out exactly as expected.\n\nOf course I'd recommend getting some Pho (stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are). You can also keep it simple and delicious by getting a BBQ pork sandwich, like I almost always do (and if you really want to be like me, make sure to tell them no mayo).\n\nBut seriously, if you take one thing away from this review - TRY DESSERT. I'm not a fan of the spongy-green cakey things, but the deserts in the cooler are usually very good. I'd recommend any of the coconut-milk-based concoctions in the plastic cups. Ask for a cup of crushed ice, pour the dessert on top, and enjoy. Don't be freaked out - there will likely be some sort of beans, maybe seaweed, who knows what - but it will be delicious.\n\nDid I mention the people here are awesome? Great food, great service, and your wallet won't be sore the next day (neither will your stomach).",2

"Stayed here for business.
Positives: Great staff, very helpful, very friendly. Club lounge was well serviced, inviting and friendly. Meeting rooms were big and and well lit by natural light.
Negatives: I was here for business and needed internet access the night before my meeting. Access was poor at best. VERY slow and after 45 minutes on the phone with IT it was no better. The room was musty and when I showered at 6:45 there was only luke warm water. Charger access requires you climb under the desk if you have more than one electronic item to plug in.
I cannot comment on gym or pool but I must reinforce the great attitude of the staff. It was very refreshing and welcoming.",2

"Just back from a week stay at the Courtyard Marriot San Diego LIberty Station. This was an altogether pleasant experience from beginning to end. The staff, from the front desk to the restaurant, deli and housekeeping were excellent. They were consistently friendly, polite and very helpful in regards to remedying a tiny concern we had. (missing sofa chair in our room). The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable.
In terms of location the hotel is near the airport, however, if you know San Diego this is not far from the city at all and also very close to Old Town. We had a car so the ample free parking at the hotel was a bonus. As parking in the city can be tricky we did cab it one night at a price of 16 dollars each direction. Parking at Old Town in the various San Diego State Park parking lots (free) or on the street never gave us a problem. I personally would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again and expect I very likely will in the not too distant future. Great stay!",2

"Brian and his crew are awesome. Before the Ultimate Lawn Maintenance (ULM) crew arrived a couple of hours ago, our front yard and backyard were in pretty bad shape -- i.e., overgrown rosemary bushes, a palm tree with ghastly prawn stems jutting out, weeds here and there, a dead sapling, a dead bush, and a monster plant-like entity that had gone unnoticed for an untold amount of time (we're never in the backyard).\n\nNow, a short while later, I can confidently say that our digs are the best on the street! \n\nThe guys from ULM were great, master wielders of service that's at once fast, mindful, and meaningful. Not a single detail was missed. They even capped unused irrigation heads!\n\nWorthy to note, too, is the fact that Brian responded quickly to our initial contact attempt and had his crew at our house merely a few days later.\n\nWe'll be calling ULM again!",2
"Had the chef's tasting menu...about 10 courses. Almost every course was excellent. Duck breast and short ribs were the best I've ever had. Staff is also very friendly and you don't ever feel like you're in a stuffy restaurant. If you're going for the tasting menu, don't finish each one of your courses. You will be in major pain (as I was) afterwards. I just HAD to finish my courses because they were so good!",2

The hotel was funky and in perfect position for seeing all the sights. The concierge desk was very helpful in advising some bars and restaurants for this very special trip. We were on 19th floor and yes the room is small but we only slept there so it wasn't a problem. It was very clean and well decorated and had everything we could have wished for. The bar in the lobby did get a bit loud but then it was to be expected and on 19th floor with the air con going we heard nothing! The doorman, the waiters, the porters and all the staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough to help. I loved NYC and I loved the Hudson.",2

"Best Cinematography I have ever seenConsidering the year the movie was made I was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity. Though I am not particularly a western movie buff.every single scene is given the utmost detail, and it is haunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. At times I am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes, but I am never bored. I feel as though I am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. I recommend this movie to anyone who is studying set design, location planning, and for that matter photography in general. It can be a humbling movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touch-up that we now experience.",2
"Love Big Dog Coffee! I am a huge fan of the oatmeal bar, iced coffee and iced lattes. I normally visit this spot everyday before work (oatmeal and iced coffee). \n\nThe interior space is beautiful, sort of a anthropologie feel to it. A lot of eclectic pieces with out looking like a cheesy TGI Fridays. Also the patio area has charming wrought iron furniture for the occasional nice day in Pittsburgh. \n\nPro: really friendly staff, oatmeal bar, sunny interior, great coffee\nCon: Oatmeal bar can be a bit pricey( although the serving is huge), could use a couple more comfy cars. \n\nOverall: Great place for studying, reading, first date and people watching!",2
"I stayed here in January 2011 so quite a while ago but I wanted to write a review because I was so impressed. We got a deal with BA for four nights here, with flights included it was £500 each so we weren't expecting much, but everything was great. The location is superb, you're only a couple of minutes walk away from several tube stations. We walked to Times Square a couple of times and this was when they had snow storms and the temp was well below freezing! Yes, the room was TINY, but it was clean, quiet, lovely and warm and had everything we needed. Plus the bed was unbelievably comfortable! When you're on a city break holiday you're hardly likely to spend much time in the room so to us it didn't really matter. Staff are very friendly and recommended some great restaurants to us that we definitely would not have come across had we gone looking ourselves.
I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget trip.",2
"My husband and I stayed at the Adolphus Hotel second week of September for the ""National
Trailer Dealer Convention.
We enjoy the people the Hotel is so beautiful, we love the french decoration.service is excellent, and is located in downtown area. very convenious.
Every time we travel to Dallas we stayed at the Adolphus Hotel, maybe because of that they up-grade us to a big suite.wow We were very impressed.
I love to read Trip advisor, before I choose a HOTEL, because people like you will coment their experience, and genuine opinion.",2

"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Los Angeles to attend a conference. Therefore we got a conference rate. We had to pay for everything ourselves, so we do care about value.
The good news: The staff was friendly and helpful. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Upon check-out, the front desk was thoughtful and generous enough to give us a little discount, because we complained that the room smelled like some previous guest had a dog in the room recently. (Note: we couldn't change rooms because the hotel was full.)
The bad news: Incredibly, there wasn't any coffee pot in our room! That was very inconvenient when attending a busy conference over several days. There is a Starbucks in the lobby but it always had a long line due to the conferences.
If you order coffee from room service it was around $9 for the coffee plus added fees of about 25% !!! Our conference provided free coffee only in the early morning, but the conference room was far from our bedroom on the 12th floor...so how do you get free coffee in your room for breakfast? Answer: you DON'T! )-:
I associate the name ""hyatt"" with luxury, but our room had no robe, no slippers, and no coffee maker!
Tip: There is a Gelson's supermarket in the mall around the corner...we did get a few groceries to bring to our hotel room for a quickie breakfast. You can ask for an empty minifrig for your room for $5 a day.
There is a charge for internet too, although it was discounted for the conference.
If our conference is in the Hyatt again next year...yes I would still attend and stay at the Hyatt. I did appreciate the friendly service, and I appreciate the small discount upon check-out (because the room smelled like a previous customer had a dog in the room.) This was a nice gesture.
Would I choose this Hyatt for a romantic splurge, though? No, if I was paying full price and looking for a romantic getaway, I'd stay elsewhere.
I rated this room ""3"" for cleanliness because our room needed a deep carpet cleaning for example. On the other hand, the daily housekeeping were very good about keeping our bathroom clean, and giving us fresh towels etc. every day.
In my opinion, this Hyatt is a bit TOO pet-friendly.
Oh yes...we didn't hear any noise at all from the hallway, which was nice. But the wall seemed a bit thin between our room & the next one...so that we could hear their television, and we could hear them opening the drawers on the other side of the wall. Fortunately, our neighbors didn't stay up too much later than we did, but it was a bit annoying.
Overall, I'd say this Hyatt is average for a large hotel which accommodates conferences. They would get a lot more points from me if they provided a coffee maker in the rooms, with free coffee, and also if they didn't charge to have a mini-frig in the room.",2

"I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the past two years and I am sad to say that it has gone downhill. Two years ago I thought that I had found a gem and was nervous to even tell friends as I wanted to keep the secret to myself.
My last stay was a week ago and I booked a partial ocean view for two nights. I knew that the rooms are rarely ready before 4pm so did not bother checking in until my conference was over for the day. Upon check in I was shown where my room assignment was and asked if there were any other rooms (I knew this one was not optimal). The gentleman at the desk told me that they were entirely sold out - he assured me that I would like the room. Needless to say, the room was not acceptable. It was directly over the lobby of the hotel and essentially faced the street with a street light shining in to the room and cars parked behind it. When I called and said that this was not what I had expected - he asked in a snippy voice ""can you see the ocean?"" to which I replied "" not really, there is a light glaring into the room"". I told him that I would prefer to check out than stay in this room and then magically there was another room. Both days that I went to the pool there were no towels for the beach or for the pool (only a pile of used towels). In fact, I stood next to a soaking wet man in the lobby the second morning as there were no towels at the pool so he was going back to his room to dry off. The ""breakfast buffett"" is in a small room that feels rather dirty - you can get a tray and bring items to your room which I recommend. The rooms are still nice although do not feel quite as pristine and new as they did 1-1/2 years ago. I agree with the reviewer who stated that if you have a car, you are roped in to the $20 parking fee as there is sparse overnight parking around the hotel. I am not sure that I will stay here again - would probable consider renting a beachhouse if I needed to be by the ocean.",2

"It seems to be getting harder and harder to find decent business-style hotels in New York at a reasonable price. When I am travelling alone on business I don't really want to spend many hundreds of dollars per night staying in uber-luxury places on my own - I'd rather save my cash for when I'm vacationing with my family. But I want a level of comfort that doesn't make me totally miserable to be on yet another long business trip.
In this regard, Kimpton hotels seem to hit the mark pretty well. I've stayed at quite a few recently and the Eventi is definitely close to the top of their range in quality terms.
The hotel is located at 30th & 6th which is not an area I've stayed in before, and isn't that convenient for me frankly as most of my meetings are generally in mid-town but what it lacked in convenience it definitely made up for in quality - plus as an added bonus it is right near Korea-town where I had one of the best Korean meals I've ever tasted (and that includes several trips to Seoul!). There is also a subway very close to the hotel which meant midtown was literally minutes away.
Arrival was very straightforward, no waiting in line, no long forms to fill out plus they remembered to offer me the $15 complimentary credit for the mini-bar which I get as a frequent visitor to Kimpton hotels. As usual they were also offering complimentary wine 5pm-6pm in their verandah bar which I think is a nice friendly touch.
The room was a very good size for New York which nice bathroom and very comfortable bed. Wardrobe was fine and as usual they offered free internet.
The hotel seemed to be something of a hot-spot as there was some sort of fashion event going on one night which looked like fun.
I didn't use the restaurant.
Check-out was very easy.
Will definitely be back.",2

"Was in the City for a conference downtown, and the Hotel Triton was recommended for its location, less than two blocks away. Its quirky charm, bright colors and perky staff made an immediate impression. Amenities are modest but good quality, and the small rooms have charmingly innovative decor echoing the beat poet theme of nearby North Beach (the wallpaper is a typeface excerpt from Kerouac's ""On the Road"").
An easy walk to Chinatown and Union Square, the Triton feels authentic, not like a chain (but has Kimpton consistency) and the staff was attentive and competent. The lobby is inviting to hang out in, and our stay was made more pleasant because we were at the Triton.",2
"Moscow Domodedovo to Minsk. My previous experience with this airline was quite negative, but this time, there were almost nothing critical to complain on. The procedure of online booking and check in was smooth and quick, recently Belavia introduced low-cost tariffs (without checked baggage, etc) which allowed to make prices more reasonable. Ground procedures in Domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airline's fail. On-board experience was great - I was lucky to get modern aircraft because Belavia still operates some ancient Boeing 737 Classic but this time it was a new B738 instead. Cabin crew were awesome. There was even a meal service (ham/cheese sandwiches) despite the flight is just 1h long. What was rather disappointing - bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in DME and MSQ. Maybe they have a reason for this, but in both airports I saw a lot of vacant jet bridges. Also - cabin was very cramped like in low-cost carriers. Possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way. I criticize Belavia often for 'cosmic' prices on European destinations, for old aircraft, for monopoly on flying to MSQ from several destinations (especially European), for 'Soviet-style' of management that one can face sometimes - but this particular flight was rather nice.",2

"We travel a lot and dine well. We live in NYC and dine out every night. We did not expect to find a restaurant in KL that wowed us like Marini's on 57. Usually restaurants with these views are tourist traps with mediocre food and service....but NOT this one. We enjoyed cocktails and the spectacular views of the Petronas Towers in the bar before sunset. Escorted into the west facing dining room we were served by a gracious and professionally trained staff who did not miss a beat. Our vegetarian ordered the 15 vegetable salad with pipettes of different dressings and aromatic sprays to enhance the salad. Inventive and fun! The various entrees were all excellent and beautifully presented and served. The sun set over KL and we went on to enjoy the pre dessert surprise (I won't ruin if for future diners) and then beautiful, special desserts followed by a complimentary offering of house made chocolates. This was a spectacular experience with a sophisticated well dressed clientele. We highly recommend it!",2
"I've been here several times and each time it has been a perfect experience. The food is excellent and the wait staff is just as good. I also like the old style look of the place and that it has both table and raw bar seating, which looks into the clean, busy and stylish kitchen. A few of the menu items I've had are diver scallops crudo, grilled octopus, peel & eat shrimp, roasted artichoke hearts, blue crab salad, halibut and bouillabaisse. The wine selection is also very good. I recently had a pinot noir on tap that was fantastic. Enjoy!",2

"We stayed at Hotel Monaco for a long weekend (4 nights) while visiting San Francisco for the Outside Lands music festival at Golden Gate Park. I will be reiterating much of what has been said by others already. We had a great stay and found the staff to be very friendly. We arrived very late due to a delayed flight from the east coast and found the fellow at the reception desk to be very kind and helpful. We were in a normal room with a king size bed. The room decor goes with the Kimpton boutique-y feel, which we liked. I found the room to be a little small, but it was suited well for our needs. Everything was clean and tidy. The housekeeping staff members that we encountered were always smiling and would inquire of our room number when passing in the hallways so that when we returned from a quick breakfast, our room was already clean.
The hotel offers free coffee, tea, and other beverages every morning in the lobby lounge area, and free cold drinks at the main entrance all day long. Wine tasting is offered each evening, but since we were out, we did not have a chance to do this. It is pet friendly and I was a little sad that we were not offered a temporary pet (fish) during our stay. I realize now that it may be just for the kids...
We ate twice a the Grand Cafe for breakfast and would definitely recommend. It is convenient and the food is very good. As far as location, as mentioned by many others, you will most likely want to make a right when coming out of the hotel for exploring, rather than a left. When making a right, the hotel is only about 3 blocks from Union Square with all kinds of shopping, street art fairs, trolley rides, etc. When making a left, the area is a bit rough, but if you' have experience with other cities, it's not too bad. We did walk through this area at night twice when we were returning from the shows and didn't have any problems. It's just something to be aware of.
Overall, this was a great hotel and I would (and have) recommended it to others. There are a few other Kimpton properties in SF, so depending on the reason for the visit, I would certainly stay here again or at one of their other hotels.",2

Many thanks again to Mary for being especially helpful in locating Camera shops for me to purchase another one in Las Vegas.
If I ever return to Los Angeles I will certainly stop at the Angeleno and will also recommend this hotel to my friends.
Wonderful people.

"Wir waren 3 Nächte im Liberty in Boston. Zweifelsohne ein sehr schönes Hotel an grossartiger Lager. Wir hatten ein adäquates Zimmer mit Sicht in den Hinterhof.. Kleiner Fitnessraum. Wir wollten unseren Aufenthalt noch eine Nacht verlängern und da wurde uns eine völlig absurde Rate von USD 600.-- pro Nacht vorgeschlagen. Wir haben dankend verzichtet und uns stattdessen (zum Glück) für Newport RI entschieden. Beim Check-Out haben wir festgestellt, dass uns ein nicht konsumiertes Frühstück fakturiert worden ist. Seltsamerweise fühlten sich weder Rezeption noch das Restaurant für den Fehler bzw. für die Korrektur des nämlichen zuständig. Wir wurden vom einen zum anderen geschickt und wieder zurück. Eines Top Hotels ist ein solcher Service nicht würdig. Sollte ich Boston wieder besuchen, dann bestimmt nicht mehr im Liberty. Auch wenn das Haus stylish und die inhouse Bar / Lounge offenbar sehr angesagt ist!",2

"After having read previous reviews of this facility I was initially reluctant to stay here. I won a sweepstakes associated with NASCAR and this included lodging picked at random based on a voucher system. I have traveled to the Charlotte area frequently but had never stayed overnight because I live less than 2 hours away so I was not famliar with downtown Charlotte or the hotels. We arrived VERY late because we attended a race in Concord first. Check -in was by 2a. We left the track after 1a - got lost thanks to my Google directions. The lady at the front desk was EXTREMELY helpful and gave me correct directions. When we arrived she greeted me with ""You made it!!"". When she learned that my vacation weekend was due to winning a contest she comped my parking which was normally $10/day.
As for the facilities/room - we stayed in a 2 bed STANDARD room. The main sleeping area was furnished in a contemporary style comparable to the website photos. And the lobby are was simply magnificent!!. Our bathroom had not been remodeled so we had a standard tub/shower therefore no problems with shower overflow as have been previously described in other reviews. My husband did have trouble with the shower water mixing well - it was mainly hot and had to be constantly adjusted while showering. The door to the bathroom opens inward so this makes a tiight squeeze - maybe the hotel could change the hinges on the door to open outward toward the open closet area. The room was very clean and we had daily change of bath linens. The TV was nice and large with extensive cable access including free premium channels - for us a race fans having the SPEED channel is a must!!",2
very nice app 👍❤️,2
"This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach's house) that are really used. It's primarily at the coach's house, however. A movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. One is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic.First off, I love the actors in this film. They've all been household names to me. They proved their worth here.One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up on the coach. He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. His blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - ""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!"" It's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them.",2
Absolutely lovely Christmas ornaments really pleased thank you studio,2
"Stayed at the hotel for two nights while in town for a wedding. We arrived late on a Friday night and left early on a Sunday morning on Delta. Having the hotel in the terminal was simply amazing - no shuttles, trams, trains, etc. - just wake up, check out, and walk right out through the dedicated security line! The staff at the hotel was very accommodating and friendly. We asked for a room with a view and were given a room that faced the tarmac. There was absolutely no noise from the outside; however we could hear the occasional conversation coming from the hall way as people walked by.
Overall the room was clean and very comfortable, though the pillows weren’t as comfortable as I remember. We took advantage of the hotel bar and found the food (appetizers) and drinks to be pretty good and relatively priced for a hotel bar.
All-in-all a great hotel and we will be back for sure!",2

"I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years, especially ""Strictly Ballroom"". While the music is nice and the dancing colourful, for me the movie is not about dancing. It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life. He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted, at least eventually, by family and audience. Attitudes to ballroom dancing, as conveyed in the film, are definitely non-Western, though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the colour, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch.",2
"Great food , live music. Lots of fun",2
"The staff here are the most helpful and pleasant of any resort I have visited. In fact it was remarkable how much each person connected with the guests. I am not a golfer and yet when I walked by the golf course I was offered cold water and visited with the golf scheduler about the course..
The amenities are really excellent. The two salt water pools are pristine and again the service at the pool was outstanding. The pool valet brought cool water and towels and was attentive without being intrusive.
The work out facility has top rate equipment. The classes were amazing ( I did yoga and world dance). I also went on the canyon waterfall walk with the naturalist. That is truly not to be missed, he has so much to show us about the geology and the wildlife you couldn't possibly ""see "" on your own.
The food is superb. We dined in every location on the property. Uniformly the food was outstanding along with the service. Eating on the heated outdoor decks was a treat.
Turn down service is usually ho hum but not hear. Rose petals strewn about, slippers put by the bed, amazing chocolates and bath salts for the tub.... really nice touches.
They will take you in the ""house car"" to the local beaches and set up chairs and umbrellas for no charge. This truly is a wonderful service. Unlike some resorts that nickel and dime you to death, this one charges a reasonable amount and provides outstanding service.
The beds were comfortable, the linens top notch, the resort quiet and peaceful and VERY clean.",2
"The propery is older, somewhat outdated, but clean and comfortable. I found the prices quite high for such an average property. My room was quite small compared to most Embassy Suites. The restaraunt and parking are quite expensive, so you would never think of the propery as a bargain.
On a more positive note, I did find the staff to be helpful and attentive, and breakfast was decent. I suspect most guests are business travelers that are not concerned about costs. I will look for a more cost effective alternative next time I bring my family to Boston, as the Metro System makes it quite easy to stay a bit further out where hotels are much more affordable.",2
"The travel experience started from check in to arrival in Sydney, and all of my experiences were great. We were picked up and transferred to the First Class lounge.

While the similar funtions is for 20 mins, beside it is a toy for my girl, i use it to count the time for my girl to watch Cartoon. Very satisfied my purchase.",2

"The W Hotel excels at providing cool, comfortable and stylish accommodations in a somewhat hectic area. Construction at the WTC site makes getting to and from the hotel somewhat challenging although most taxis have seemed to have figured it out pretty well. I did however find it a bit on the noisy side and out of the way to where I spent most of the time while in NYC. Perhaps next time, I will book at another location.
I enjoyed my stay at the W and can only reiterate what his previously been mentioned by other guests. Rooms are kept spotlessly clean, cool and stylish. Loved the bath products and the very comfortable bed.
Service was polite and efficient if slightly cold.
On the good side - I did get an upgrade to a better room with my SPG membership.
On the other hand - After I had checked out and arrived home, I was surpised to find that the hotel had charged me $147 for the box of munchies which had not been touched. I did get a reply from the hotel that this error will corrected swiftly and I am hoping to see a reversal of the charge. -- errors are forgiveable if corrected quickly.",2

"I stayed in this hotel en-route to El Paso on business. Upon arrival at Fort Worth airport, I called the hotel to arrange for the free shuttle bus (which is advertised on their web-site) to come pick me up at the airport, but unfortuantely for me, the shuttle bus does not service Fort Worth airport !!!! Must read the detail next time.
The hotel desk clerk who I spoke to said that I would have to either get a taxi (which would cost about $45) or if there was one available, get the ""super shuttle"" transport vehicles which would cost me about $20. Luckily there was one of the ""super shuttle"" vehicles about 20 yards away and they organised a 'truck' for me which arrived 10 minutes later to take me to the hotel.
I only stayed at the hotel for one night, but it served it's purpose, the bar friendly and well priced, the restaurant's menu provided a general selection of food and the room basic but clean.",2

Ok... so I woke up spontaneous this morning and decided to get a full car tinting... I happened to be browsing groupon app and found Alex and Denise' 305 Kustoms website the night before with a ton of phenomenal reviews from yelp... and they carry the renegade and 3M films which are both top-o-the-line materials... so after I grabbed a big wad of cash for rent and utilities I just drove westward towards their business area.. since it was a nice day in las vegas to just blockout the 120 degree summer that usually lasts until October... I got to 305 Kustoms at 8 am so I got to give them my business to start their day.. and let me tell ya that I am so happy with choosing their 35% VLT renegade film that I told Denise to just keep the change for the awesome work that her teammembers did for my vehicle.... I guarantee you that I'm coming back here for more epic tinting for my girlfriend's car and highly recommending these folks to my best friends and coworkers... they haven't seen the last of me yet because I will make sure to keep their shop open with more business that I will be bringing... I work for Sands corporation which is the largest resort here in Sin City by the way so you know I'm bringing in a ton of clients for 305 Kustoms in the near future.. I also discovered that they have a facebook so I'm heading there after I finish here... Good honest kind people like Alex and Denise here in Vegas is hard to find like a pearl in the ocean so we as locals should do our part to maintain their longevity... I got 5 on it.. 5 stars for 305 Kustoms!!!!!!!!!!!,2
Comfy spot to just sit in and relax. Conveniently located. Very friendly staff.,2

Would give it 5 stars but I haven’t had to try it out yet. Hope I never do.",2
One of if not the best burger I have had the Britannia Burger was so damn good. I thought I was dreaming. I sent compliments to the chef and the manager. Thank u again I am gonna come back to Vegas just for that.,2
"With the Nasdaq firmly in correction territory, strong corporate earnings out of the tech sector could be a lifeline for investors.",2
"Stayed 1 night in the InterContinental Mark Hopkins with a family member on a vacation in San Francisco. The hotel is very conveniently located when exploring San Francisco. The hotel has a very nice lobby and the architecture is impressive.
Room was on the 14th floor with a magnificent view over the city, room was very spacious however decorations and furniture was OK, nothing especially impressive.
Bathroom amenities adequate, however I've had (much) better in other Interconti's.
Beds were superb, absolutely nothing to flaw and the room could be made quite dark, which I find very important at hotels.
We had Club access and food/drinks provided were good, however also not the best I ever had at InterConti.
Staff was pleasant and helpful.
All in all a very solid albeit slightly pricey choice when in San Francisco.",2
"This is a very nice, though expensive place to stay. San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. We spent 3 nights in February at the Sheraton and found very clean and well-appointed rooms.
The staff was a little too high brow for my personal liking. I am not rich, but do enjoy staying at nice places when I travel and when every staff member you come in contact with expects a tip for whatever mundane task or for simply doing their job, it becomes very tiresome. I don't mind tipping for service above and beyond the call of duty, but needing to tip 3 people just checking in is a bit much.
My other complaint would be the rooms that face the bus station across the street. There was loud noise and activity going on all night. We asked to change rooms and were granted a different room, though more expensive of course.
Overall, if you are a family travelling on a some sort of budget, this may not be the best choice, but if all the nickle and diming doesn't bother you, this place is fine.",2
"My girlfriend and I stayed in a King Jacuzzi room, and I must say this is one of the nicest hotels I have ever been. The staff was great, from the moment we got there we were treated extremely well and provided everything we needed. The shuttle drivers were awesome, took us straight downtown. Jimmy's had a great happy-hour too, regular menu is kind of expensive.
Additionally, my girlfriend (who ended up having it in her laptop bag) was missing her debit card right as we were checking out, and housekeeping and a number of front desk agents took time to personally go up and look for it. The service went beyond just having us in and out; these folks genuinely wanted to help us.
I highly recommend this hotel, and have nothing negative to say about it",2
"Unfortunately, in cases such as these, there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened. This movie is a victim of such circumstances. The writers (too many of them) have decided to take ALL of the stories and give them to the audience to let them decide which version of the truth they like the best. As in the real life case, there is no clear answer, no conclusion, and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled (like coffee without the caffeine, or sex without the climax). Whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there. At least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to (and this does).That is not to say there are not some great performances here. Kilmer (as Holmes) does an outstanding role bringing some humanity to what is otherwise an unsavory character. Kilmer, and the real life lovers and friends who consulted on the film, let the audience see a selfish, troubled human being who, though his faults were many and large, was loved and cared for by many people (except himself). Kudrow as Holmes's wife, only gives a glimmer of the dramatic actress she can be, but it is very noticeable and unforgettable glimmer. Bosworth's character was not as emotionally complex as she could have been and needed to show more inner conflict to give credence to what ultimately happened between Dawn and Holmes (she turned him in 6 months after they fled to Florida). Bosworth's apple-cheeked performance is at time annoying, at times touching, but shows none of the backbone the real Schiller must have possessed. The other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity. Lucas is a great performer who could have sunk his teeth in to this role had it been fleshed out for him. Even Dylan McDermott was surprisingly capable in his role of drug dealing biker. The fault of this movie does not lie with this cast, but with the writing. Too many cooks spoil the soup, and this kettle, filled with so much promise, ultimately leaves you hungry. The story and characters may have been less than sympathetic, but in what movie of this ilk are they not so? Other movies such as 1989's drugstore cowboy starring Matt Dillon (who was reportedly asked to take this role and refused) worked with similar subject matter and mastered it to such a degree that you felt a kinship with the main character by the end of the movie despite what he had done. Van Sandt could have given James Cox and his crew a few lessons. Had someone bothered to try and find the truth, this would have been an intriguing story. As it is, you will find the accompanying WADD documentary more palatable (in the 2 disc DVD)and much more informative. You will realize from the DVD that Holmes was not a bad guy, but not a very good one either..as are most people.",2
Some bugs and glitches need to be fix Eg.my friend has shared something to me yesterday so it will show just now on the image,2
"The 1997 low-key indie dramedy Henry Fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to revisit for a sequel. A rumpled, dissipated drifter (Thomas Jay Ryan) strolls into town. His anarchistic rantings and delusions inspire a nerdy garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems, while Henry half-heartedly tries to boink the guy's sister (Parker Posey). As the poet prospers, Henry declines. Nothing special about any of the characters or the story. A pitch for Harold and Maude's Ghost would have been quoted higher odds of ever making it to a screen.But Parker Posey ain't the semi-official Queen of the Indies for nothing'. So when writer/director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, a film was born. Though we catch up with the same characters many years, they're in a completely different sort of dark comedy; this one's laced with espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possible double, or even triple, agent - for years before meeting the others. He's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries. Everyone wants his rambling, incoherent journal which just may contain coded secrets that could destabilize nations and economies. Posey's Fay is either the wife he left to go on the lam, or his widow, depending on who's telling the truth. Fay's efforts to find Henry and/or the hotly-contested journals include a globe-trotting gauntlet of multinational hit-persons and henchmen at every turn. She never knows who to believe or trust. Nor do we.While herding these unlikely characters into Jason Bourne/Jack Ryan territory, Hartley's script retains the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance, steering clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical menaces. His sly lampoon of the paranoia, duplicity and musical-chairs alliances of today's geopolitics starts to crumble towards the end. Even so, fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of Hartley's recycling methods. (5/18/07)",2

I helped set up a Project Dinner Table event in building B of the World Market Center and wow! What a gem they have hidden here in terms of meeting space. \n\nI've heard conflicting information on whether or not this place is open to the public and was told while setting up that it is. The one area I'd definitely want access to is the terrace where we were setting up. It overlooks downtown and part of the south end of town and would be a great setting for a wedding/reception.\n\nLooking forward to going back and checking it out again if it really is open to the public!,2
"Pricey but food was excellent. And the ambience was really good too. It's one of those places where by looking at the staff you can't really tell who's the boss because everyone seem to be so casual, clued in and in charge.",2
"This is one of those places that all the hipsters and cool people dig...which usually means I hate it. But it's actually super-badass! \n\nIf you're a gamer or pinball aficionado, of course you'll dig it... so this review is for people like me, who despise video games. \n\nFellow anti-gamers, if a significant other drags you here, don't worry -- there is plenty to keep you entertained! The artwork on some of the old-time pinball machines is awesome -- favorites include Night Rider (70s truck-stop motif), Guns 'N' Roses (you can get a bonus where a hot bitch takes her top off!), and the self-explanatorily-awesome Nugent. So if you approach this place like an art gallery, you'll be totally rewarded.\n\nIt's not just pinball, either -- they have all these weird, creepy old-time arcade amusements, like this creepy marionette clown-in-a-box that you control by pushing buttons. There's no score, or bonus levels...you just make him dance around by pushing buttons. Simpler times! Then there's the baseball game in which you control an actual doll, helping him swing his bat at a ping-pong ball that hovers over a gust of air that you also control. \n\nIf that's not enough, the guy who runs the place moseys around giving advice, and he's super interesting to talk to. And his workshop is interesting to peruse...he's got all these old gutted machines out and ready to be repaired.\n\nAnd if you get thirsty, there's a machine selling old-time throwback sodas, which adds to the retro arcade feel. Now all they need is a pimply, fuzzy-lipped 15-year old stoner in a jean jacket selling weed out back. Goooooooooood times!",2
"Its soooo good! Had the kiki's burger, it was delicious, unlike anything I've ever had. The salt and pepper garlic fries were so flavorful.",2
i just feels so artistic whenever we need to do something like decoration and stuff,2

"I pretty much love this place. The decor is fun, the food is pretty gosh darn delicious, and the location is ideal for us. The seating is a bit tight and it can get noisy, but the valiant and good natured staff does the best they can under these circumstances, so even when service isn't ideal, it's still fine. \n\nThe margaritas are solid, even if occasionally uneven in sweetness to sourness balance. The beer selections seem good to me, but I defer to Steve L. to opine on that.\n\nThe one, two or three taco dinners are a great deal, you can mix and match from several chicken and pork options as well as steak and tilapia. Toppings are fresh, I love the crunch of shredded cabbage, and the handmade corn tortillas are so light and tender. I would love to see some shrimp offerings as well. I haven't had a bad one yet, and the serve yourself salsa bar makes it easy to customize your dish with the flavors and heat levels you prefer. Portions are generous, I always have enough left over for lunch the next day.",2
"I stayed here for a conference in Dec 06. Had a view of the pond w/ fountain, that was nice. The beds are extremely comfortable, but the rooms aren't all that special in terms of decor. The lobby and public areas are gorgeous, and the workout room is exceptional. Their cardio machines each have their own tv screen.
I did not appreciate the outrageous fees for internet and self-parking. On the flip-side, concierge/parking attendants got us into an exclusive club, vip, with reduced rate.",2
I really like using Yelp but could not find this location on here and I knew it was just around the corner from my house so I went over there and grabbed a business card so I can add it to the list of good ice cream in the Arcadia area.\nI was very impressed with the smiles and the welcome I got when I walked in here tonight with my friend. When we got there we found so many good choices and the young lady behind the counter seemed to enjoy what she does and the makes me want to go back for more.,2
"i just finished watching Dressed to Kill,which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had both the""R"" rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the ""R"" rated version,i can't be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the ""R"" rated version.but i digress.Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it's really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,Dressed to Kill(1980)is 10/10",2

"My husband and I just stayed at the Royal Palms Hotel to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. Although the grounds are very beautiful, the rooms are romantic, and T. Cook's Restaurant and Lounge, and the service by the pool are all extraordinary, the business end of the hotel leaves QUITE A BIT TO BE DESIRED!
When we arrived, our room was not ready and the person at the check-in desk said he would call within the hour to let us know what the status of our check in would be. When we had not received a phone call more than two hours later, we stopped by the front desk. The person did not seem to remember us, but another person at the desk asked if our phone number was on file and said that she would call. The second Royal Palms representative did call, and we ended up checking in about 3:30 pm (which is a 1/2 hour before the scheduled check-in time --even though I sent a request asking about an early check-in since I knew that we would be arriving around 10 am). Although we understand that our room was not ready early, I would have appreciated the call that the first representative said that he was going to make so that we could have made a better use of our afternoon.
I was surprised that the room did not have a fireplace. I had called the property to inquire about fireplaces in the Deluxe Casitas (where we were booked), and was told that those rooms did have fireplaces; yet, we were placed in a room without one. The room was cozy, but I was looking forward to this particular amenity. On the second night of our stay, we had to call housekeeping to receive turn down service and request to have our towels changed.
My biggest problem with the Royal Palms was the check-out/billing procedure. First, my minor issue. I had asked for our boarding passes to be printed (since that is a service that the Royal Palms offers), but the person at the front desk did not remember to give them to me until I asked. OK, a little oversight, but coupled with what followed, it just made the ""little"" oversight magnified.
My major issue has to do with billing. First we were given the wrong bill (with someone who was charged about half what we paid per night for lodging). Then we were given our bill with three nights' charges for Rose Petal Turndown Service when we only had that service the first night. The Royal Palms check-out representative then deducted the subsequent two nights and informed us that we would receive an updated e-mail version of our bill before we were charged. I did not receive the e-mail version of the bill, but my credit card was charged for the total of the invoice I received upon departure and an additional amount. After calling the resort several times to speak with someone in accounting, I left a message asking someone to send me an updated (and corrected invoice with an explanation of any additional charges). When I received the e-mail with an updated copy of my bill there was ANOTHER FRAUDULENT CHARGE! I spoke with someone after receiving that invoice and she seemed a bit annoyed with my inquiries and requests to have the charges explained and removed.
Finally, there were so many events being hosted at the Royal Palms (at least one every day of our visit), that the staff often seemed pulled away from their lodging guests. It seemed that during our stay there was not sufficient staff to address the needs of ALL guests, those lodging at the property and those hosting special events.
For a property of this size, requesting what the Royal Palms requests per night for lodging, service should be seamless and all guests should feel like they are VERY special. We are not picky guests, if it were not for the abovementioned snafus, we would have never interacted with the Royal Palms staff since I had arranged all of our activities and dining options prior to arrival. In the event that the service is not seamless and the guests are not made to feel extra special, the property management should follow-up with guests to the best of their ability to explain the situation and offer some sort of compensation. I have traveled extensively for business and pleasure, and have stayed in large and small hotels where the management generally seemed to be concerned with the well-being of the guests. I did not feel that this was the approach at the Royal Palms Hotel.",2

The rooms are a bit dated but they are large and very clean.
The pool on the 22rd floor is fantastic and includes 2 large hot tubs.
The manager's reception is nice with good drinks.
The only thing they are missing is a nice bar were you could have a drink later in the evening.
Not that there a no places near but this place just ask for more time to be.",2

"An amazing place to stay in the heart of Cherry Creek, the Inn at Cherry Creek offers more than just a hotel. Just two blocks from the Mall with great shopping, the hotel has underground parking making it easy to get settled. The location has so much at ones fingertips ( a long biking or running trail satisified the need for a great workout.)The rooms are quite nice, but what sets this hotel aside from others is the personal touch of the management and staff. The manager,David Norbit and his wife Donna, make one feel so welcome. The staff is more than happy to accomodate guest in anyway possible,and go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. .The hotel lobby has a lovely seating area and a large screen apple computer for guest use. . The Weber, restaurant with excellent food, offers a choice of terrace dining, indoor casual and a small fine dining area great for a romantic meal.

"I've seen my share of Cirque du Soleil shows--I first saw Mystere some nine years ago, and I've since seen O, Alegria (twice), Dralion, Varekai, Corteo, Delirium, and Zumanity. The performances seldom disappoint--the artistry and music and feats always combine for an amazing spectacle. \n\nKA, however, introduces something only hinted at in some of the other shows--brilliant set design. In KA, the stage itself is one of the amazing characters, performing its own contortions, wardrobe changes, and hydraulic acrobatics. Pyrotechnics warm our wide-eyed faces as we watch. Apart from the stage, the set surrounds the audience, with performers swinging over our heads, shouting from behind our ears. KA is probably Cirque's most narratively-coherent show, as well--there is a clear plotline to the story.\n\nUnfortunately, the set malfunctioned during our show--when it came time for what I would later realize was a climactic performance on the Wheel of Death, the set froze, and the musicians played on. We sat listening to the music, mildly disappointed that we were missing some key scene in the story. \n\nI think it speaks volumes, however, that even without the show-stopping sequence that I've seen in both the program and other materials, KA is still by far one of the best Cirque performances I've ever seen.",2

"8/6/2011\n\nThis was my second visit to Fast Lap this year and they definitely did not disappoint!\n\nPros: \n Open late (until 11 pm) most of the week\n Friendly staff\n Quick carts \n \nCons:\n Very hot (temperature hot).\n Helmet visors need are all scratched\n \n\n So I took my girlfriend's brother here for his birthday and it was super dead. I was surprised considering it was a Saturday evening. I could have sworn it was going to be packed (totally wrong... we were the only ones there). I had purchased 2 races for each of us. Since we were the only one there, the worker running the track gave us the option to do one 20 minute run or the typical two runs at 10 minutes a piece. He recommended doing the 20 minute run as it would allow to master all the turns and give us a chance to conquer the track. I figured that it was an awesome opportunity to do so and that's what we did. He ended up beating the first half of the race, but I finished in first at the end. \n\nInfo & Tips:\n If you have never been to Fast Lap, be prepared by bringing your driver's license and to fill out a waiver prior to starting. The next step is watching a 2 minute safety video. It's a little cheesy, but your attention is needed. After doing so, I recommend you use the restroom if need be. You don't want to suit up then have to use the restroom 2 minutes before race time! I love dressing up. I think it's part of the experience. Suit up in your choice of red or black. After going through the second set of doors, you have other safety gear to put on(not in this order ha): Helmet, head sock, neck brace, and racing gloves (optional just like the race suit). \n Don't forget to pick up your paper, which tracks your best time, fastest lap, top speed, etc. etc. Keep it for bragging rights and take a picture with it on the podium (you'll see the podium). \n Totally awesome. More so if they had helmets with visors that weren't scratched. If you have your own helmet, you may bring that one. Don't forget to check out the photo wall in the office and see what celebs have raced the tracks of Fast Lap. I'd most definitely recommend this place. Even though it's family fun, I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids. I could see how it could be dangerous...and don't think that you are too old to have fun at Fast Lap. That's nonsense and a tell-tale sign that you are probably scared to put the petal to the metal!",2

The wine list is out of control! My husband is a sommelier and loves going to this restaurant. They don't mark it up very much, so it's fun to experiment with wines that at other places would be twice the price.\n\nI always take my out of town guests here. Truly a gem!",2

"This hotel is palatial, both for better and worse. The location is a plus, since it's close to
downtown Chicago and is just a couple of blocks from the shopping on the Magnificent Mile. But it also feels oddly isolated, especially at night, because it's surrounded by wide streets and overpasses. Our room had a nice partial view of Lake Michigan, which was a plus, and the room itself was very pleasant. The bed was remarkably comfortable. But the huge lobby felt almost deserted, with no one at the check-in desks and no other staff in evidence, when we returned to the hotel just before midnight on a weekday. It probably has a much livelier feel on weekends. All in all, I recommend it. Plan to take a cab if you're returning there at night.",2

"I booked this hotel after reading other reviews and was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel itself looks very average from the outside, even checking in and seeing the lobby and going down the hallway to our room was also quite average, but once we got to the room it was a WOW. We arrived early and our king room wasn't ready so we got upgraded to a king suite and I have to say this hotel is very similar to many of the Marriott's and Doubletree's I have stayed in with regard to room furnishings, TV's, and room amenities. The kitchenette and bathroom had granite countertops and the bathroom was the roomiest I have ever had in a hotel. The bed was comfortable to the point that I looked under the sheets to see what brand it was in anticipation of my next mattress purchase for my home. We had an incredibly spacious balcony that was at the rear of the building so not much view, but surrounded by trees and very quiet and private.
Our trip was divided up into two different stays at the Royal Palace and on our second stay there the following week, our room was equally as nice just not as large as the king suite was. I have to say that the hotel front desk staff seemed mostly indifferent, but the housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a fabulous job keeping the hotel clean. I usually wear socks in hotel rooms rather than go barefooted, but in this place I was confident enough in the cleanliness to go totally without socks and shoes in the room. This place even smells clean, and that's no small feat for a hotel.
The area around Royal Palace is very nice, felt safe, and had plenty of options to shop and eat within walking distance. It is also very close to UCLA. The only real drawback is parking is very tight here, but at least it is free and that's more than many LA hotels have to offer.
I was impressed with this very small, unimpressive looking hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip to LA. For purely selfish reasons, I hope word doesn't get out about what a great place this is to stay, because if more people knew about it, they would have a very long wait for a reservation.",2

My favorite dog park in the valley. Lots of great owners and dogs. Let's start with just getting to the park. I've never seen the parking lot full even on the busiest of weekends when softball games are going. So great parking. The park has 3 different areas. 1 area is always closed to regrow grass which is nice. There is an active area and a passive area. Entrances are double gated and also have separate gates for if you are leaving or coming inside. Once you are inside the grounds are maintained pretty well. I've seen a few times that mud puddles have started from over watering but that is very very rare. Each area has its own little play area. One has a small selection of agility training objects. 1 has a series of tubes that your dog can jump up and go through the tubes and the last area has a series of boulders to jump on. Dog owners are attentive and pick up after their pets. Although you will see the occasional poop in the grass. So watch your step! Also on the active side I've been happy to see some knowledgeable dog owners who know the difference between play fighting and an actual dog fight. My dog is the most playful dog I've ever seen and enjoys doggy boxing leading to a game of chase. \nThe only negative thing about the park is the water fountain. Water pressure is horrible and also there is only 1 fountain in each area. On nights and weekends when it is super busy there is a giant crowd of dogs trying to get some water.,2
charsiew looks gd but hard n Saltish instead of mildly sweet.meng kee is still better,2
"This hotel is not right where the action is - it is about a 10 minute walk to union square and 15 - 20 minutes from Fisherman's Wharf, BUT if you are willing to do the short walks (or use the excellent public trans that comes right by the hotel), this place is great!!! Everything is clean, the room was a decent size (we were four women and we did not feel cramped), beds were really comfortable and the staff are beyond compare. Right away they make you feel welcome. You really get the feeling that they love their jobs and enjoy meeting all of the guests. We were in town for the Nike Women's Marathon and when we got back to the hotel after the race all of the staff started to clap and cheer - so sweet!!
Every night there is a happy hour which never seems to end unless you want it to (we didn't and our happy ""hour"" lasted 3 hours and our glasses always seemed to be full - thanks Edgar!!). I asked about some little paper stars that were around the lobby and next thing I knew was getting a lesson and supplies so that I could make them at home with my kids. The kids love them! Theo was a very patient teacher!! All of the staff were the friendliest I have ever encountered in any hotel, I just can't say enough about them!
We had breakfast at the restaurant and it was very good, and there are 2 bars very close by, one a lounge type and the other a more active sports bar. Everything else was a bit of a walk but it wasn't too bad, as I said, just a few blocks to Union Square.
If I go back to the area I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to any of my friends!!",2
Nice food and cosy place,2
good stream tonight will be back with more Mad Max tomorrow.....I want a PS4 so I can play Until Dawn fackkkk see you tomorrow!,2
i struggle here i wish myself back in nice and i feel sure it would solve all my problems,2
i can sleep more soundly here than i can anywhere else and i feel like it is vital to my physical well being to come home every few months just so i can get a week s worth of real sleep,2
"You won't regret coming to the dental clinic... I felt really cared for and they really seem knowledgeable! The student dentists are really professional and they take their time to treat you (in a good way!). They don't rush. Like a previous review said, if you plan to make an appointment with them, make sure you block 2-3 hours.",2
"I stay here often because it's between downtown and Rancho Bernardo where I work. The location really works because it's easy to hop on the 163, 8, or 805 to get where I need to go. Downtown is 15-20 minutes away. The Mission Valley/Fashion Valley area is 10 minutes away. The hotel is squeaky clean and the staff always takes great care of me no matter what weird problem or request I have.",2
i was tired and not feeling clever,2
"In my humble opinion, this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and this was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together. The movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart, and I was weepy for several days after seeing the movie. Sometimes love isn't enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see this in our own family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking -- I was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, ""But when I am alone in the half light of the canyon, all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul, and memories. And the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, and a four count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters."" These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie (by Robert Redford who is narrating as Norman Maclean), are basically scripture, in my opinion. Any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography. It was beautiful!",2
"Works for me!!
This is really anti glare but feels a little sticky but after all it works fine!!",2
There have been a couple times where I tapped on the person that come up on my phone making a comment and nothing will come up and it just goes back to the statement again.,2
"Great story!
Another great read. Just love S.Eddie's books. Love Silas and Jasmine and their family. Chimera is great also. You will not be disappointed.",2
Awesome Fish Tacos. Had the Full with all the sauces and it was great.\nWill definitely eat again.,2
"Its a great place to help people or get help from others! You can do allot of things here not only for talking and teaming up with others, but also for map design or usage of official game's mod tools and such so yep its just amazig 1 down side is that there is no feuture to post an image with text meaning that you can't post a message or what ever you write with a picture. If you want to add text or explain about the picture you've post the title of the post is all you will have to describe it",2
nice pizza,2
"This airline had impeccable service, I am a loyal Air New Zealand flyer, but Singapore Air has given me something to think about when booking my next long-haul flight.",2
"Nice room, but wished that the refrigerator would have been available without a cost. Bathroom was very small, but nice. Elevators are VERY small and VERY warm...and got stuck in it also. Valet was very helpful with directions and other questions that we had. In room safe kept beeping all night long and could not fix.",2
"We found Dr Carlsson's office when we found out that my middle daughter needed some vision/eye therapy to address an eye tracking issue. His office and staff are great, and even though it was a long way to drive, we definitely feel it is worth it.\n\nIn addition to the vision/eye therapy, we have also had eye exams (for both me and my youngest daughter) as well as glasses and contacts for me. I am very pleased with the quality of service and friendliness of everyone in the office, and I highly recommend them.",2
Very funny film with some of the best swedish actors. It's all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feeling. Most of the film you are aboard a train headed for Berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns. I truly recommend this film if you like to laugh.,2
Nice to listen to music. And you can follow your friends,2
The best tang hoon tauhu soup that i have tasted.,2
"I have taken my dog there several times during the year for trips. She LOVES this place. I think she's almost sad when we get home that all of her play friends are gone. The owners are extremely nice and helpful. My dog is thirsty when she gets home, but I doubt its because they aren't giving her water... that's absurd. Shes been there for weeks at a time. I think she's just so excited she doesn't think to get a drink. The prices are awesome compared to any other boarding facilities, and I love the fact my pup is only in her cage when shes eating and sleeping. They are also very most vets would barely let her out. I love that place and not worry about that long review, they seem to over analyze every part of the stay.. So your dogs were thirsty after they were playing... thats normal! Same with comment about this location not having lush field in the back... its a shopping center! They have enough property outback for your dog to potty and come back into the airconditioner to play again.",2
"As an American living in SE Asia, it is always nice to stop in occasionally for a margarita and nachos. It is always busy here but the staff tries hard to serve as soon as possible.",2
"Excellent flight to Singapore. Lovely, helpful staff and all on time. Comfortable premium economy seats.",2
Other than ads all is okay,2
"The produce here is amazing. Got two pounds of fresh blueberries for $7.50. I am a huge fan of salads and that is intensified during the summer when it is too hot to cook. The amount of vegetables and fruits are seemingly endless. The prices are low and the associates are super friendly. \n\nAfter dinner, I rushed here to get some shopping done and got in at 8:15. I know they close at 8:30. I, also, hate when people walk in at the last minute, but I REALLY wanted blueberries and Greek yogurt ($4.99). I ended up getting a little more than that and when it was time to check out, the cashier was still smiling and making small talk. The employees definitely deserve recognition for their positive and even tempered attitude.",2
"Great product
Love the vest. Wish they came in more colors i would buy more.",2
"Nous avons séjourné une semaine au Marcel at Gramercy. L'hôtel est bien situé (transports, attractions, restos...) et le personnel est très serviable. Les chambres sont assez petites mais plutôt confortables.
Toutefois, l'isolation phonique des chambres laisse à désirer : la notre était située à l'arrière du bâtiment et était très bruyante en raison des climatisations. Avec les boules quies, ça reste supportable mais peu être qu'une chambre sur la 3rd Avenue (assez passante) aurait été plus silencieuse (plus de chambre sur la 24th street).
Je recommanderais cet hôtel pour un court séjour à NYC, ou alors pour ceux qui ont le sommeil lourd.",2
i do like the new bits but also feel like some of the functions and features that i was very fond of have been reduced this isnt going over well with me,2
great apps and service.,2
"Previously we had stayed in the museum area and had not experienced the main drag--just off of Chestnut Street, but the Westin really changed our minds. It's 1/2 block away from all shopping and restaurants and is, in itself, a return to civility and service. It's the first time i have seen a big hotel with a non-stop, 24/7 concierge who worked hard to make our stay comfortable.
We like Starwood in general because they always stand behind the hotels in their chain, plus you often see an old luxury hotel that you might not have stayed at before join the chain and you get to try it. That's what this was and we had a great summer time weekend rate.
Go there for the location, the service and the people. Make a special trip to see the Barnes Foundation collection (Vaut un voyage as the Michelin folks say) and stay here.",2
"This is the blog posting I have at <url> regarding my stay here.
We’re travelling. Usually, that’s a good thing, but we’ve observed that there are times when it could be better.
Anyone who’s read my blogs knows that we’ve stayed in a lot of different types of hotels / guest houses / cruise ships / etc. Usually, they’re pretty good. I can only think of one time where we flat-out said, “Uh-huh. This ain’t going to work.” We walked across the street and checked into another facility. Usually, though, we’re pretty flexible on those things.
There is, however, a set of circumstances where you simply can’t change regardless of how unacceptable the facility is. The hotels understand this and essentially hold you hostage.
The event, of course, is the downtown convention.
You’re usually trapped because you have no car, American cities have sucky public transportation and there’s not another hotel room available for close to 20 miles. They’ve all been taken up by the people attending the convention.
This is the situation we found ourselves in while checked into the Hyatt in downtown Phoenix.
The brochures, either online or in the conference materials, made this place sound like Shangri-la downtown. “Hip, urban furnishings,” and “excellent amenities,” are phrases that stood out.
Let me say first that the staff have been extremely friendly and helpful. They are, after all, simply imposing the policies that administration has set down for them. The policies, however, reflect a Gestapo-like mentality that one usually only sees in airports.
After all, you are trapped. You have no choices. You will purchase from us, or do without.
Hence, a bottle of water in your room (which has no refrigerator, microwave, mini bar, safe or anything else) is $5.95 a liter.
That’s in US dollars.
That’s about $22.49 a gallon, for those trying to make the conversion. This is unfortunate, because you’re going to need a lot of water, even in the “cool” season in Phoenix, which we’re supposed to be in here in mid-October.
That means it only got up to 97 yesterday. Now, normally, your choices are then to either lie by the pool or stay in the A/C. In this case, though, it’s tough because the A/C in the room isn’t going to make a lot of difference for your afternoon nap.
It will cool you to sub-arctic in the middle of the night, when that one thin blanket they’ve left in the room will become woefully inadequate, but at 3:00 in the afternoon – prime nap time – it’s not going to happen. Low 80’s is about the best you can hope for, especially if you’re on the west side of the building.
They offer suggestions, though, on the little placard that takes you through the bizarre temperature control that is hidden in the darkest corner of the room with no light and requires that you sequentially punch no less than 5 buttons in order to attempt to change the temperature.
Namely it says, keep the drapes closed.
This, when their advertising hype has broadcast that the Hyatt offers some of the most spectacular vistas in downtown Phoenix.
How the hell would you know what the view is like if the drapes are closed making it as dark as midnight in your room??
I guess you’re supposed to simply suck down another bottle of that $22.50 a gallon water and enjoy it. Note that this is more than the airport charges for their security-cleared bottled water. This presumably just comes off the truck at Sam’s and doesn’t require a background check.
The water, which you can choose to buy or not, is just one of the annoyances here. I don’t take points off for not caring for the décor, which they describe as “hip, modern and urban,” and which I would characterize more as “southwest garage sale”, but the building is absolutely dismal because of the lack of light. Everything is soft lit with 40 watt bulbs hidden by indirect lighting fixtures, so there are lots of shadowy nooks.
If it were an alley at dusk, you wouldn’t walk down it.
It’s kind of like living in a film noir, and you can’t help but feel somewhat depressed after having been subjected to it for a relatively short period of time. If mold grew in Arizona, it would grow in this hotel. The dankness here relates not to the dryness of the atmosphere, but rather to the induced state of mind that comes from being in the building.
Even that I can work through, though – after all, you can go outside and see what there is to see – which isn’t much in downtown Phoenix, but there’s a nifty little light rail line that lets you go either north or south all you want for $3.50 a day.
Of course, you have to guess what you’re going to find after you get on it, because the “concierge” (i.e. the head bellman) doesn’t have any maps to show you where a mall or shopping or anything is. The best I got was “get off here and wander around, you’ll probably find some stuff.”
Here’s a news flash – I don’t “wander around” when the outdoor temp is pushing 100. I get the hell wherever I’m going, suck up the air conditioning and then get the hell back to air conditioning again.
So you stay in and use the internet to do your work.
That’d be if you’re willing to pay $12.40 a day for internet, which goes on the blink roughly once an hour. It comes right back, but of course whatever you were working on is lost by then and you get to start over again.
If anyone were foolish enough to stay here for a month, that’d be $372.00.
Oh, and the kicker there – that’s not a “per room” charge for wireless. That’s PER DEVICE. You can’t change them out, so if you start on your laptop, you can’t then connect with your iPod lest you be charged again. Of course, the front desk says they contract that out and have no control over the charges. They also don’t bother to tell you that when you check in.
I’m all for making a profit, but c’mon, you don’t have to make it all on one person.
Unfortunately, the attitude seems to be that of a lot of downtown hotels that are located next to a convention center.
You’re trapped. You got to go to the conference, it’s $25.00 a day (or more) to park downtown anywhere nearby, plus with a car rental a lot of employers simply won’t pay the costs. The hotels have a captive market and are out to make the most of it. It is, in part, one of the reasons that our downtowns are dying.
Treating customers like this is a false economy. Yeah, the Hyatt has made a buttload of money on us this time around. But given that we’re in hotels roughly 20 times a year, it will come back to haunt them. I may not remember WHICH Hyatt was so sucky, but I will remember that one of them was, and I’ll be wary before we get booked in there again.
Fortunately, we’ve only got one more day.",2
i lopped off the tops and was about to send them in their usual compostable direction i was struck by an urge of frugality or economy or of at least feeling like perhaps such a lovely bunch of delicate carrot fronds should not go to waste given i do realize they re edible,2
overall its good but when we had to cancel need to pay for the grab thats sound weird,2
"The best!!\n\nWe had a thee hour flight delay - no problem! They called from the baggage claim area within 5 minutes of us landing letting my group know there were there. We were greeted by a man in a tux who helped with our bags and walked us out to the air-conditioned limo. We lucked out and got an automatic upgrade since our flight time was messed up so we got the big mac daddy of limos! It was so fun and they had chilled champagne ready to go for us. \n\nOnce we left the airport we turned on the beats, the flashing lights and drove down the strip. Even thought the airport is close to the hotels it took about 30 mins to get there, which we were happy about. It gave us time to enjoy the ride. \n\nThis was honestly the best way to start out the trip and it was very affordable - especially if you split it between the group. They also have deals online that you should look out for and jump on. We took the limo roundtrip and both ways the drivers couldn't have been nicer. Thank you Christopher and David!! You made us feel like queens!",2
"Have stayed over 5 times at the Logan Hilton prior to early morning flights. Comfortable, clean rooms. Easy shuttle ride or covered walk to the airport, and very friendly and accommodating staff.",2
"Location is a bit hidden but the salon itself is wonderful! The staff is knowlegdable and friendly and although the location is relatively small there are plenty of beds and bed types to choose from. There has also been a dramatic improvement in the overall appearance of the salon over the past few months. Very clean :). I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a new salon for bed/spray tanning. Also, if you have never been to any of the 12 valley locations your first tan is FREE!!",2
Super quotation Ok,2
i remember feeling the most valuable commodity in the world was a nap,2
"This is a very nice Victorian building in a very decent location. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. Most of the furniture is old and worn out (not antique, just old). There are extension cords running all over in order to power the lamps ect. (hardly any place to plug-in a computer or charger). Say a small prayer when you get in the elevator - fortunately walking up the stairs is a good option. The decor is ""I love Victorian, especially when I can decorate my whole place by shopping in second hand stores and making it look charming-ish""
The real message comes across at ""Breakfast"". The cheapest most poorly presented ""food"" I've had in a long time. There is granola and the coffee is ok. Those are the high points. Peanut butter and grape jelly on Wonder Bread is the theme here.",2
"I LOVE THE ABC STORE. \n\nI am used to loving the ABC Store in Hawai'i and this one in Vegas on the Strip is no exception!\n\nI love, love, love all the grocery selection. I was able to quickly get a gluten free lunch or breakfast here for cheap. And, oh yeah, stock up on Hawai'i-made stuff, too!\n\nTons of Hello Kitty Vegas souvenirs! If you are looking to get something awesome, DO YOUR SHOPPING HERE. Don't go anywhere else for a few groceries and stuff to bring home.",2
"Disclaimer before you come to the Rio Seafood Buffet: you MUST love seafood! If not, go to the Carnival buffet. That being said, let me proceed with my review of the gluttony I experienced.\n\nFirst off, I love salmon sashimi. That is probably my favorite dish. Rio has salmon... TONS OF IT. I was in salmon heaven, baby! I always get a plate full of salmon sashimi. Their sashimi cuts are generous and not thin and stingy like many other places I've been to. Plus, the salmon tastes fresh, it is possibly some of the best salmon I've had.\n\nThey of course, have other other dishes, which include the lobster, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, prime rib (to name a few). All are good. The prime rib here tastes ok, but not as good as the Mandalay Bay one. Then again, I didn't come here for the prime rib.\n\nTheir dessert bar is smaller than the Bellagio & Wynn buffets, but it is suffice. After swallowing everything in my path, there is hardly any room for desserts.\n\nThe price is slightly lower than Bellagio & Wynn, so it's a bit on the pricy side. As with other hotels, if you have the Platinum or Diamond players cards, you shoot to the front of the line and get a table right away... woo hoo!",2
"We couldn't have asked for a better room, overlooking the carpark was forgiven as beyond that we could see Alcatraz and much of pier 39 - including boudins bakery - a must visit for clam chowder!
The room was well equipped and comfortable, our only criticism was the tiny bathroom!
Also, don't stay on this side of the hotel if you don't want to hear the street music!",2
"Recommended by our agent, we were not disappointed. Some delicious and original dishes, but beware the portions are huge, and we have good appetites, better for 3 or 4 people! Photos are of soft shell crab ( fabulous), Midin ( local fern, a must try crispy, green and delicious), crispy lamb (yummy), Bee Hoon (fried noodles, lovely but enough for 3!), Salt squid with loads of crispy salad, again very delicious.Good range of drinks, lovely helpful staff, and reasonable prices, cheap if you consider the portion sizes.There was a big party on the first time we went so it was pretty noisy, but good atmosphere, and popular with the locals.Our waitress both times was Raine who was absolutely lovely",2
"Love the app, the adds aren't bad and most songs are on there, however, whenever I make a playlist with only 1 song in it, (1 song but it's in there alot, so like baby shark in a playlist 5 times) whenever I play the playlist songs i don't want to be in there pop up, I'm pretty sure they are from the 'what we added' part in the playlist but you can't get rid of them! You can only hide them but they are still there, It's seriously annoying.",2
"Dr. Charles makes these modules much more interesting than I have ever seen before. I am a Masters graduate from a reputed university, which is one among top 10 in the world, but I can strongly say that Dr. Charles is something different and I would love to study forever under him.The way he connects technology to real world is something fantastic.",2
"This course was great! I thoroughly enjoyed my time and the information given in this course. The videos are short, maximum of about 10 minutes, but theyre packed. I learned so much of what I had never known before. The videos were well formed and outlined, without leaving the student watching and rewatching the video to understand what was being said. I wish it was longer!",2
I will mostly remember the amazing view of the Hudson River from the 35th floor. We were greeted by very friendly staff. The lobby is beautiful and hip. The rooms are a nice size for NYC. The showers in the room were so relaxing and beautiful as well. We were always only 10 minutes away from anywhere we neeed to be. All in all a beautiful property with wonderful service.,2
Kept up to date with delivery timing - delivered when expected - delivery drivers friendly and cheerful,2
"I've been to a few Nordstrom Cafes, but this one is indeed the nicest...no surprise since it's at the Nordstrom at the Fashion Show Mall on the Vegas strip. This one is the biggest and best decorated one, plus, I think it has the largest menu. I had the Santa Fe panini and it was excellent. My boyfriend loved his California panini. Between the two, I liked my sandwich better. Have the Santa Fe if you want a little zest!",2
Facebook is most wonderful app I use him a lot of time but if you allow Facebook warehouses like Amazon so it will be better for Facebook group and businessmen thank you ❤,2

"We nice environment.
Their traditional iban food very delicious. It's worth going there but have to make reservations cos quite crowded.
Can try their Tuak. Not bad too..",2
"My partner and I had a very comfortable and easy stay (4 nights) here and highly recommend it to the cost-conscious traveler. Super clean, well run, good service, and the bathrooms down the hall were no problem at all: no waiting ever, clean and modern. The room itself was bare bones (no closet, no sink counter, no microwave) but the bed was comfortable and they provided lots of pillows when we asked for them.",2
"We stayed here for six nights in September and it was great. We had a superior queen size double and the room size was great, especially by New York standards. very comfortable bed, good sized bathroom and dressing room with plently of space in the bedroom itself. The room was cleaned to a good standard and there was no street noise. The location is fantastic - which is why we chose the Royalton, a block and a half from times square and around the same from Grand Central Station. All of the staff were friendly and helpful - particularly when the airline lost my luggage! Reception staff called the airline for me several times and let me know as soon as it was delivered. If I was going back to NYC I'd choose to there again.",2
"Food is not bad.... service is really excellent but i think for the quality and portion of food offered, it is too expensive. Not great value.",2
i really feel fantastic today and miracle of miracles ive been losing a pound a day,2
"Common areas aren't kept well. Rooms are reasonably clean. Showers have only a half-glass, so water on the floor is hard to avoid. The pool area can be a scene that gets loud.",2
I suggest you add a feature where we can put conversations or group chat in a folder so that we can sort and easily find specific conversations. Thank you!,2
"The customer services representative was professional, courteous and polite dealing with my complaints which was later resolved to my satisfaction.",2
I will use this company again in a heartbeat! Gerald was great. The guys who came out and did the repairs were friendly and knowledgeable. They helped me find a way to keep the cost down. A+ Service!,2
Someone answered straight away and I got the work done successfully,2

"Yes, I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy had worn out.My family received a VHS copy of this movie when we purchased a new VHS system. At first, my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new VHS system she let me watch it.Like I said, this movie is every little boys dream The movie contains a terrific setting, big muscled barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes you'll only get when you get older. So, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first, I was bored, then started thinking about how much I loved this movie when I was kid, and continued watching. Yeah, the experience wasn't as great as I remembered The acting is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes weren't funny anymore, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I've grown up. Even though the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the good old times you know",2

"On my last day of a quick trip to Montreal from Southern CA and having spent 3 full days of walking all over Montreal I decided to treat myself to a massage before getting on a 5 hr flight home. Checking out all the reviews on line I made a choice to avoid the higher end \""spas\"" and I decided to walk the mile plus to Studio Bliss. So glad I did!!! Anne was AMAZING!!! I get regular massages, one might even call me a massage snob. She clearly is extremely knowledgable about the body and worked on all my problem areas. Most importantly I think was that she has the touch of a person who truly loves her job, and the human body. I can just tell the minute she touched me. Her touch is tender, and yet aggressive when she found a problem area. It was without a doubt the single best massage I have ever had. Ask for Anne and you will not be disappointed. Worth every penny I paid and whenever I am in Montreal I will be booking my massage with her. FABULOUS!!!",2
"Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)",2
"Just walking from bathroom to bed my feet looked like I walked through wet tar, the carpets are so dirty and sticky. Called General Manager doesn't return call and staff said he to busy to take or return calls",2
"Andres, I loved you! \n\nWithout Andres, my stay would have been rather pedestrian. Yes, the Gault is well known for its award winning design, and may be unique in so many ways - I can't recall - to Montreal. BUT, aside from the architectural details and a comfortable bed, and the modern and brilliantly designed bathroom, the stand out feature of my stay was Andres, a concierge. He made my stay warm and inviting. Without him, it would likely have been just another brick and mortar experience with pleasant faces behind a desk. When I think of where to stay in Montreal, I only think of the Gault solely because of Andres. He did a phenomenal job making my friend and me feel welcome. Thank you very much, Andres!",2

"Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite Chinese. \n\nMy criteria for picking Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce\n\n....This place does it just right - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely not upscale!) - nice crispy/ light chicken complete with pretty good although not super memorable side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me though, personally they have the crispy chicken nailed - so Im in!",2

"This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining.Based on a song by Rogers & Hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds out hope. She helps hubby get a job in Cortez's company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know, it's pretty funny....). Finally he embezzles $5,000 from Cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to Cortez....and I won't reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; he's unattractive and sniveling, while Cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.While ostensibly a drama, it's filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. But there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point Stanwyck says to Cortez, ""My brains are in my feet, while yours are in...."" That's pretty darn suggestive for 1931! There's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the Code clamped down and whitewashed everything. An amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.",2

"This hotel is not good. At best its a bad hostel. It is not very modern and the room I stayed in was just crap.
The ""air-con"" was an old extremely loud box that was attached to the single pain glass window and shook the room - meaning that not only was it merely a fan, you could not open the window and when turned off you could hear everythign from the street.
As it turned out however not being able to open the window was in effect a good thing because it menat that the pigeon who nestled on the windowsill outside was not able to fly in - neither were his friends who flew by to say hello - again something that I have never seen in a hotel before.
There was no closet to hang anything in.
If the bathroom door was open you could clearly hear what was going on in the next room - to include if next door's toilet flushed.
The only positive thing about this ""hotel"" was its location.",2

"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only thing good about the hotel was the price. I guess the saying that you get what you pay for holds very true for this property. The disaster started as soon as we got to our room. We were given one of the ""renovated"" rooms, which was actually a pretty huge room with two queen beds, a chest of drawers and a TV. That was all the furniture we got. The rest of the room was obviously empty. No ice chests, no coffee, no coffee maker, no fridge, no chair or couch. Absolutely nothing. The room was horribly hot and we turned the A/C on. We very quickly discovered the air conditioner wasn't working. It took calling the front desk three times and their solution was to send a fan over. Thanks to one of the service guys who insisted that the room was too hot, we were moved to a new room. The new room was also a disaster. The air conditioner worked but the furniture was old and smelly. We were woken at 1 in the morning by another guest who had also been assigned our room by the front desk staff. Then we were worken again at 2 and 4 in the morning by drunk guests returning to their rooms. Breakfast was awful. Cereal and a muffin. The breakfast area smelled like urine and there was mold growing in the courtyard. They claim their pool is heated.....NOT SO. The fitness room had only ONE equipment, an elliptical. Their high speed internet was broken and wasn't scheduled to be repaired for 48 hours. The whole thing was a disaster. We were scheduled to stay for 5 nights and we had to change hotels after one night. HORRIBLE. Not worth the money you save and there are a lot of inexpensive hotels in San Diego with better quality and service.",2
"A Slice of Italian Heaven!\n\nWe went to Enoteca San Marco to try some of our favorite Mario Batali creations. We wanted the Cafe/Bistro experience rather than the dinner house confines. We were seated on the patio and watched the good times roll.\n\nThe wine list is amazing! While Mario features many of the well know vintners of the various Italian wine regions, he also offers his own unique blends and interpretations of classic reds and whites. If you want to pair your own pours with each course, Enoteca offers 2, 4 and 8 oz glasses so that you can determine what amount will satisfy your thirst.\n\nThe salad variations are spectacular. I had the Vinegar Maker's salad featuring prosciutto and 25 year old balsamic vinegar. The greens were bitter (in a good way) and the pine nuts and Romano cheese tied everything together.\n\nMy main course star was a braised pork shoulder with cucumbers and peppers. The meat was fork tender and the balance of cooling cucumber with spicy red peppers and crusty caramelized pork made for a perfect dish.\n\nDessert was a dark chocolate malt gelato that was made by the dessert devil himself. The the intensity of the bittersweet chocolate with the malted cream was frozen perfection. Add a double espresso with a hint of lemon and you will find yourself in a state of bliss that is unlike any experience I've had before.\n\nThere is so much to try at Enoteca, I can hardly wait to return. I vow to leave no carb unsampled at this little slice of Italian heaven in the Desert.",2

"The Riverwalk Vista is a stunning historic restoration......the room was so beautifully designed and felt so restful......during daylight hours. Try to sleep in this place, and it's a different story. Constant traffic noise, and the bed had an uncomfortable sway.

This is WAY too invasive for a couple trying to set the tone for a getaway!! Just weird.",2

"Josie is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again. .As she is there, she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in Highschool as we see in flashback scenes.In the flashback they show that (little spoiler) Josie was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom, only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets egged by the ass hole and his bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel warmer to Josie).I did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school.This movie did have the perfect happy ending, as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes. The acting in this movie was not outstanding, it was good for the most part of the movie, there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie.I going to give this movie 7 out 10.",2
"We stayed here two nights this week while visiting colleges in Boston. The location is great - right at the edge of Boston University's campus and walkable to MIT. The T stop is at the hotel as well and it backs to Fenway Park. The concierge was helpful in providing restaurant suggestions. Service was good. Only drawback is expense of such a great location. The valet parking was easy but a steep price ($42) though comparable to area lots. No extra freebies in the room (cups, coffemaker, breakfast, etc.). The rollaway bed was a real mattress and great for our 12 year old to sleep on.",2
"Kitty Treehouse of Dog Terror
I saw this advertised on a different site for twice the price. So was happy to have found it for a more reasonable cost on amazon. It’s a cute addition to my living room. It came in a ginormous heavy box. Was not difficult to put together by myself. The trunk is hard plastic in segments that fit over a central pole and and the levels screw onto the central pole between the trunk segments keeping them in place. It is heavy and sturdy. Good for climbing. My cat loves it. His favorite game now (a sentiment not shared by the dogs) is playing death from above. He hides behind the leaves and peaks out at the dogs. Then drops onto them like a leopard on a gazelle. Lots of fun for the cat. The dogs are slowly learning to avoid kitty’s death tree. He enjoys sharpening his claws on the grassy bit. And he will lay under the tree on the grass sometimes, like it’s a shade tree. He is getting exercise by climbing it. Now he can run right up it to the top without pausing. He gets quite the arm workout going between the levels when he dead lifts himself with his front paws, like he’s doing dips. The dogs have noticed and again are becoming more wary. So in short: cat gives it five stars. Dogs are wondering about the return policy.",2

You won't be disappointed, your stomach will be happy and your wallet won't be completely empty. The service has always been very attentive whenever I've been there and the ambiance was exclusive.",2
"You will not be guaranteed a non-smoking room. The AC is practically non-existent and the rooms are in serious need of a facelift.
I agree with some of the review in terms of being a great location and you probably won't spend much time in your room if you are sightseeing, but you do have to sleep in it and it won't be comfortable during a hot, humid summer night.
This hotel caters to a lot of European customers and they are almost always fully booked (according to one of the managers). I apologize in advance if I offend anybody, but based on personal experience I have to say that Europeans are not as picky about their hotel accomodations as Americans.
After several conversations with the manager, they did comp us are parking, but if wasn't much of a discount. It was actually cheaper to book directly through the Holiday Inn than it was through Hotwire so she essentially gave us their deal.
I wouldn't not recommend this hotel to anyone on a family vacation. It was not relaxing to come back to after a long day of tourism. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks. And don't trust Hotwire in large vacation destination cities. Hotwire customers will always be second class citizens compared to people who book directly with the hotel.",2

Food and service were excellent! My husband and I went here on our vacation because we had a groupon and it had great reviews. The manager or owner was extremely nice and gave us samples to try. The set up was fast casual similar to Qdoba or Chipotle which we love. I had a salad with the Huli Huli chicken which was delicious (also enjoyed the sample of Kalua pig). The coconut bark was a sweet and salty unique dessert which we both loved. I would definitely recommend this place and hope they franchise since we don't even live in the area!,2

"Having already had lunch & just out running regular errands this afternoon i came up to a big billboard that said, \""Voted Greatest Sandwich in America - Turn here!\""\n\nAfter thinking about this ostentatious command for about a block I whipped a U just to go for a look. I'd never heard of this place or noticed it before but these people certainly aren't lacking confidence!\n\nPosted inside was an easy to read & understand menu. Their sandwiches come in 6\"", 12\"" & 20\"" sizes and the Capastrami 12\"" Sub sounded so good from the ingredients that I decided to go ahead & try one. It comes with hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Swiss Cheese and Russian Dressing on some kind of terrific roll.\n\nSoon my sandwich, completely & tightly wrapped up was ready. I was already impressed by how big & heavy it was when I picked it up from the counter!\n\nBack at my table, I had to see if this huge thing was anywhere near as good as they suggested on the billboard.\n\nOMG, this was not just the best sandwich I've ever had, it might have been the best ANYTHING I've ever eaten! It was just absolutely, positively 5 Stars out-of-this-world AMAZING, & the service was great too! :-)) :-))\n\nWorld's best ANYTHING: $8.99. Grab your keys!!",2

"Every time I am in the Phoenix area, I have to come here. HAVE TO. I am not trendy, I am not hip, I am not with it and yet I feel so cool when I walk in to this streamlined coolly lit, dj playing place. \n\nWhy must I come here? They make an excellent mai tai (my obsession) that is the perfect amount of sweet and tangy. They have Pimm's cups too, which I also adore, especially after a long sweltering day of sitting by the pool. (I know, life is rough!)\n\nThe food is super excellent as well. I love the dipping fries with the three sauces and the gallette appetizers. I dream about their perfectly executed cobb salad. Seriously, it's that good. And recently, my friend got their burger and I discovered that TOO was amazing! You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is really friendly and on top of it. I've been here on really busy Friday nights and super quiet Tuesday evenings and am always treated with the utmost respect and care. \n\nIts been a great place for groups (6+) or for just a romantic duo. It's really cool and classy without being pretentious, uppity or trying too hard. Seems unlike the rest of the Scottsdale cougar scene and more laid back. I really enjoy it here and am already dying for another cobb salad.",2

Al momento dell'arrivo l'accoglienza, la professionalità dimostrata sono state perfette.
Il personale durante la permanenza, durata dieci giorni, si è dimostrato gentile ed accomodante, facendoci sentire a casa nostra. Sempre!!
Pulizia della camera, gli arredi, i servizi resi, sono stati all'altezza della struttura.
Se proprio c'è da cercare un neo è nella rumorosità della cemera dovuta al traffico e dalla rumorisità dell'impianto di climatizzazione anche spento, il tutto compensato abbondantemente dalla magnificenza del letto.
Due note sui servizi: il valvet per il parcheggio e per internet, il cui costo è eccessivo.

"One of the many perks of staying at the Mandarin Oriental is this sky bar. It has a great view and it's voted one of the best views in any Vegas hotels. What's even better is that this place isn't pretendious, it's really laid back, great jazz band, and great menu. \n\nFriday night, my husband and I came here for some drinks. We had walked all day and we had just relaxed in the sink-in tub in our room so I dressed down a lot in a dress and flip flops and still got in. The waiter asked for my ID and I forgot it so I went back to my room to get it. I came back in and there was a guy at the door all of a sudden, he greeted me and asked for my ID. I asked him how old I looked and he said I look very young to be in a bar, touche! Well, I'm old enough to be in a bar so I got in and got my drink (Golden Leaf) where my husband was waiting for me. Along with our drinks, we got glasses of water and some snacks. My husband loved the wasabi nuts, they were hot but he couldn't stop eating them.\n\nWe moved from the bar to a table and had a great view of the strip. It's a similar view to our room, except it's from the 23rd floor. After two drinks, we closed our tab and headed toward the elevator back to our room.\n\nAs we were walking away, three people at the bar asked about our DSLR camera and we striked up a conversation. They asked if we were on our first or second date and we told them we've been married for almost 6 years. They were impressed and we started talking, exchanging phone numbers and they bought us drinks. My glass was never empty because our new friends kept insisting the bartender pour me more champagne.\n\nThe bar had closed and we were asked to hang out at the lobby lounge where we talked and hung out until 4:30 am. \n\nThe next night, after walking around other hotels and having a few drinks at the Cosmopolitan, we came back here for a few more drinks, this time I dressed up a bit more. The band played a song my husband really liked and he asked me for a dance. I told him that no one else was dancing but he didn't care, so we got up and we slow danced and went back to our table for more drinks.\n\nMy favorite was the tea-cocktails, I love tea, I love cocktails, put them together and you got a happy Cindy. I got the tea-tini. The view was so nice, we didn't want to leave. \n\nThis place made our stay at the Mandarin Oriental JUST THAT much better.",2

"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for a business trip. I travel a fair amount for business, but this was my first stay at a Ritz Carlton. There really is a difference! From being greeted by name at check-in (how do they do that?) to the super-attentive service, it was a very enjoyable stay. My room had a large flat-panel HD TV, so I thought I'd watch some DVDs I'd brought to watch on the plan. When the bellman took me to my room, I asked if there was a DVD player for the TV. There wasn't, but he said he'd see what he could do. When I came back from dinner, there was a DVD player all hooked up to the TV. Nice! The hotel is a 10-minute walk to the restaurants and shopping in Georgetown. The White House is a 10-minute walk in the other direction. There's a metro stop a few blocks away. There's a large athletic club onsite, so it's easy to get any type of workout you might desire.",2

"Great coffee shop...great by Madison standards and would be great in any city. The reasons for loving this place?\n\nOutstanding tea (Loose rishi tea, properly brewed--epic win). Free, reliable wi-fi. Good baked goods. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I haven't sampled this, but they also have Yerba Mate. Great layout with two levels, and a diversity of workspaces, from tables of varying size to single seats for solo people working. A bit of a dark atmosphere--dark floors and walls, but there are nice big windows overlooking the street. Great both as a community space or a semi-private place to work. Great location in the heart of the downtown near the capitol. They also serve food. And the people working here are friendly.\n\nYou simply cannot go wrong with this place. It's a great asset to an otherwise boring block of Madison's downtown.\n\nBTW, if you would like to review individual teas that Barriques sells, check out this site that I've created -- <url> -- it's an interactive site like Yelp, where you can review individual teas. I'm pretty sure that all of the teas (and Yerba Mate) that Barriques sells are listed there too. No coffee reviews, sorry!",2
"I have been buying from this store for 5 years+-. I have never had a bad experience. Chris Is a friendly guy to deal with. I used to make jewelry and bought whatever I needed from the store.

You can buy a card of 5 batteries for probably Kmart, Walmart, etc charges you for 2 of them.

When we entered the restaurant there was a wait and the hubby and I were afraid it was gonna be awhile since the place was packed. It was just our luck that there was a table available for 2. (I guess everyone waiting were big parties.. Lucky us) Anyway, we were surprised that. This place offers AYCE Sushi. Which of course we had. The sushi was delish!! Very fresh and they were NICE thick pieces.\n\nNext time we come to Vegas, we will pay this place a visit... \n\nEnjoy! =)",2
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Riverfront in Jacksonville, Florida for one night. This was a last minute decision as we (I was witha small group of peoplr) passing through Jacksonville for the night and decided to stay over night. My reviews are usually pretty detailed with photos but unfortunately due to the length of my stay at this property, I was unable to take photos or have the detail I usually have. However, I will do my best.
The lobby was extremely opened with it containing several onsite restaraunts and a sports bar I remember named ""JAXX."" It appeared that the second floor of the hotel contained convention/conference space and the time that we had spent at the Hyatt, there were a few conferences being held there. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were nice and were pretty clean. The views were pretty good with some overlooking the Jacksonville River and the surrounding bridges. The rooms not only contained two comfortable queen size beds, but also an extra marble sink in the small hallway area. There was average size closet space in the room and hangers were supplied for our convenience.
The valet parking at the front of the hotel was quick and convenient. At $20 a day though, it can get pricey if you are there for a prolonged pierod of time. The service was friendly and could not complain about that.
The location was within short walking distance of the Jacksonville Landing Entertainment area and within a short distance of Alltell Stadium.
Finally, if you are flying out of JAX, there are a few machines in the lobby for your conveneince to print out your boarding passes.
All in all, it was a nice hotel for a night or two when you are in Jacksonville visiting or travelling on business.",2
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for a conference.
positives:
It's in a great location; two blocks from the Convention Center and a block from the 16th Street mall and pedestrian mall.
The staff was very friendly.
The room was clean.
free wireless (although it wasn't password protected and that was a bit disconcerting).
Two computers and free printing available 24 hours a day in the lobby.
The beds were comfy, although a bit too soft for me.
Bathroom was clean with great water pressure in the shower.
Did like the fact that the room was completely dark when the curtains were pulled (they provided a handy little clip) and the door was closed. It was also quiet.
Our room temp was just fine and we were in Denver when it was 65 one day and below zero four days later. The AC/heater would kick on erratically; running for 30 seconds and then stopping; but it wasn't that obnoxious.
negatives:
The sheets were a bit abrasive. All the pillows were soft; I'd prefer a firm pillow or two.
Not much to look at from the outside because the rooms are in a high rise above a parking garage.
Room had a crappy 27"" CRT television with a curved screen.
They didn't offer a program where you could designate that the cleans and towels shouldn't be laundered. So we left a note for housekeeping and they honored our request.
I can't speak to the elevators, because I'm claustrophobic and use the stairs.",2

Our first room was on the 20th floor. Carpet was stained and M&M's were left in a few spots on the carpet. Obviously a great cleaning job by housekeeping. On Friday night, there was a band playing for a wedding directly above our room. It was too loud to talk! The management was surprised we found this disturbing but eventually moved us to another room. The bell hop told us it was this way every weekend night!
Overall, this hotel was a major disappointment.",2
"Bingo fun
Very fun to play with several ways to increase points as well as building puzzles and playing other games in conjunction with it. Love it!",2
"Stayed here for a convention this past weekend and we were satisfied with our stay. Rooms were clean, Starbucks on site and right on the River Walk! One down side was, we checked out our room and had all of our bags sent into the holding closet. They did not do a bag count (neither did I), and one of our bags was missing. We did not realize this until we were already home. Called and of course they did not see it. So wish they would improve that for future visitors.",2
"We went to a night game. Walk took about 10 mins. No problem walking to the park, but walking home was a little scary. Lots of police around stadium but after walking several blocks the scene changed a bit. Hotel is located past a few large parking garages and office buildings and near a construction site. Breakfast was just OK.",2
Friendliest waiter I've had in a while. Mom is in the back cooking and has been cooking for her different restaurants for 20+ years. \n\nPho was even complimented by my picky 8 & 12 year olds. LARGE servings of pho and also noodle dishes.,2
"So, my mom and I visited your store, and had a rewarding experience. we had a person help us, angel bruner, who provided us with exceptional/excellent assistance. my mom, 81, experienced a poor experience with someone before, so was forced to physically come to the store, and we met with angel, and she took care of my moms needs/concerns promptly, efficiently, but most importantly, NICELY with lots of respect and good listening...keep up the good work !",2

"Piu' che camere sono appartamenti, grandi e in ottima posizione per visitare NY. Unico neo la metro non proprio vicinissima. Si puó tranquillamente cenare in stanza usando i take away. Prenotando tramite Venere tariffa ottima. Rivolgetevi direttamente a loro per farvi venire a prendere in aeroporto, si risparmiano soldi se lo spazio del taxi non basta",2
"Sydney to Los Angeles with a stopover in Nadi. Check in was easy with no waiting, aircraft left a few minutes late due to normal Sydney delays. Nadi is nearing a make over and no doubt the new lounge will be superior to the old one which is still usable. Flight from Nadi left on time, I slept most of the way to LAX and the plane landed ahead of time. Food offered was of a good standard and the service was friendly and efficient. The stop in Nadi does break up the flight and the new look airport will be a big boost. A good flight all over, the IFE is limited however there where decent choices.",2
Good Sea food..Sedap Sempoi,2
"The best pizza in town! Great service and food came out quickly, especially on a busy Friday night. Our server Cesar was courteous and professional. You gotta try this place if you love good pizza.",2
The item that I wanted was in stock and at a good price. The assistant discussed my needs and confirmed that it was suitable choice. I am very satisfied with it.,2
"It is the best for music very little ads, and a variety of songs . I love it",2
"Stayed at the property while attending business convention downtown. Very nicely appointed, clean, great service, and friendly staff. Since it is downtown Houston, when walking at night, you must always be aware of your surroundings. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.",2

"Born and brought up in India, it was such a relief for me to find a restaurant in Ipoh which not only sold authentic Indian food but also had one of the best services I have ever experienced. The staff is very helpful and friendly and food just amazing. So happy i found this place :D!",2
so far so good impressed 5 stars from me,2
"Sapporo is a diverse location. The restaurant features a trendy bar, a traditional dining area and their piece de resistance, the Teppanyaki style tables (Hibachi to some, or even Japanese Steakhouse if you prefer). \n\nTheir dining room menu looked extensive, but from our perspective, if you are going to go to a place that will do Teppanyaki style, that is what you have.\n\nIf you have never been to a restaurant in this mold (Benihana's, Kyoto's, Kobe) I highly recommend it. Tables are set up to seat 8 people along one long and the two short sides of a rectangular table. The other side of the table is reserved for the chef to work as he comes and prepares your food on the grill surface in the center of the table. The chef's are trained to not only make delicious food, but also entertain you while you wait. They are masters of their equipment and I am sure do not recommend you try any of their tricks at home in your own kitchen. \n\nSapporo serves your meal with fried rice rather than most of the other restaurants which offer fried rice as an add-on to the meal and serve steamed white rice. I was glad to see fried rice come standard; it is the highlight of the meal for me (isn't it criminal to hear me say that when I order two lobster tails as my entree?). Each dining guest receives a bowl of mushroom soup, a salad with the house ginger dressing, a shrimp appetizer, mixed grilled vegetables and your entree. It sounds like a lot of food. Well, ok, it is a lot of food. But don't worry, while chopsticks are on every place setting, forks are available. \n\nMany if not all of these restaurants offer Kobe beef, which before our dinner at Sapporo, I had never tried. One in my party ordered it and offered some to share. I have to make this statement clear: Kobe beef was the best steak I have EVER had. Kobe beef is from cattle whose days feature massages and a diet enriched with beer, and no I am not kidding. (*You will never want to order Kobe beef cooked longer than medium rare.)\n\nSapporo is located at 14344 N. Scottsdale Road near the Greenway-Hayden Loop.",2

"This is a class A property which is a short walk to Michigan Avenue yet on a quiet street away from the mayhem.
The lobby is chic with a nice wine bar Evo that doubles as a coffee bar in the morning. Staff is great.
Room was large on a corner and very clean, comfortable.
Ate at the onsite restaurant Aria previously and thought it was great. Had great meals in Chicago at Jellyfish and brunch at the Signature Room atop the Hancock Building.
Great property.",2
"Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the ""I'm going to make you cry"" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée. A year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, Ben, an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas. Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and moves in to their new home. Having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name Ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, I would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. Will Smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.7/10",2
Like I said its a hidden surprise. It well written well acted and well cast. I liked everything in this movie. Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side. Angelina Jolie is great in this and I'm totally watching every movie with her in that I can get my hands on. Well worth a look.,2

"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on June 9th and 10th for our second visit to New York City in less than a year. While not everything was perfect, it was about half the price of most other hotels in the area. We don't go to New York for luxury, we go for the sights, the sounds and smells!! The location is excellent for theatre or shopping or dining. We have no complaints about this hotel whatsoever. Yes, the elevators are slow, but I kept telling myself that I was on vacation so what's the hurry??
We requested a room with 2 double beds and that is what we got. The room was a little dated but the bathroom was brand new and spotless. Lots of towels and hot water. Not too many channels on the Tv but again we didn't go all the way to New York to watch TV. One thing we did love was the free Wi-fi. We both brought our laptops.
We are already planning our return trip and will stay here again.",2
"Good environment, good food but a bit expensive",2
Delicious local dishes/orang ulu dishes serve here. Non halal.,2
"A nice family oriented restaurant. Their specialty is lobster or crab noodles. The set dinners are also tasty, wide variety and very affordable. Highly recommended.",2
"I really enjoyed this book. Kate, Bobby and Cale were so endearing that I didn't have a problem with them having a polyamorous affair. I am not familiar with the concept of polyamorous relationships, but the concept just didn't seem at all odd while reading this story. Cale and Bobby are the closest of close friends who don't mind sharing a woman. Kate is looking for a revenge sexcapade when her car runs off the road in a snowstorm that has closed the roads. They pull her out of the creek and they spend the next few days enjoying the new ""friendship"" that happens during the storm. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more books from Delilah Devlin. Her characters were wonderfully written and the story was hot!",2
"This place is amazing - I wont go into a lot of detail since everyone else already has but for the price you get so much more than you would on the strip - We had the $55 prix fixe (half off for ladies on Wed!) and the food was fabulous! We had three appitizers (Crab Boulette, Cauliflower Soup and Cheese Souffle) two entrees (Pork chop and Filet) and one dessert that we were too full to eat (apple tart). I would recommend Rosemary's to anyone that enjoys great food and meticulous service - I even received a call a few days later inquiring about our experience. A definite 5 stars!!",2
"Everything is perfect with Spotify,just some and only some times it's will take your payment if your paying for premium about a few days earlier,but it's in general not a bad or worst thing, love this, had it for 4 years, no problems whatsoever, regardless if what any other idiot says",2
"If you are visiting the Boston area give yourself a remarkable gift by staying at this hotel. My husband and I were fortunate to be able to take a anniversary trip to Boston and our accommodations were ""the icing on the cake"". From the moment we entered the stately lobby until the bellman and valet tucked us into our car the day we left, we were treated royally! On our arrival we were so surprised when shortly after we settled into our room we were sent up a complimentary bottle of wine and a cheese platter with a card signed by the front desk to congratulate us on our 36th anniversary. Other details such as providing iced lemonade (in the lobby) to the guests as they came back to their rooms in the afternoon (remember this was during a heat wave) were mind boggling. This type of attention to detail, and service ( always with a smile) is a testament to the running of the hotel. Every staff member we encountered always seemed to not only respect the guests but their colleagues as well. I cannot say enough about this hotel. Believe all the positive reports you have read -------other hotels could learn from the running of this establishment. To the the staff whom we had the pleasure of meeting. Thank you! Until we meet again...............",2

"One of the best horror/suspense movies I have seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare. I expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare it to ""Open Water"", but I disagree because I thought Open Water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same ""realistic"" style.The actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.I had tears in my eyes at the end. I must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and I am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.",2
"Stayed here Aug 8, 2012, with my daughter for a quick getaway. Took in two shows on the same day. Anyway, outside of hotel is being renovated. Rooms was very ""cool"" and ""hip"". Window shades were something we never saw. They kept the room extra dark in the bright summer morning. Bed was extremely comfortable. Flat screen, wall decor, lighting were very 2012. My teenage daughter LOVED the room. i did, too. Best thing is we got there at 10am assuming we would check in and leave our bag until our room was ready at 4pm. To our total surprise it was already available at 10am. Unheard of. We practically fly up to the 18th floor to unpack. Staff was also very nice and always asked if we needed something as we passed one of them.",2

"It's Ice Cold Outside so we Made Sesame Milk Ice Cream
We love these sesame milks. We were nervous to taste them since sesame often has a bitter nutty taste but not these products. If someone gave us a taste test and covered our eyes - we would never know the difference. There is no after taste and each one is creamy and delicious. We love they are plant-based and we're not only getting extra protein but they're ethical and good for the environment. While we continue to use them in our cereal, we had a taste for ice cream so we tried the chocolate in our ice cream maker. It was so good. Our kids had no idea it was not regular milk and practically licked their bowls clean. I was worried about the consistency but after 15 minutes in the mixer, you can see above it came out thick and rich. It was so tasty. Today we warmed up the leftover chocolate in the microwave for hot chocolate. The consistency stayed the same. If you are looking for an alternative to milk and don't want to consume dairy or lactose - this is the right option. We never have been a fan of soy, almond or oat milk so happy to find a nondairy alternative that's good.",2
"Spent 8 days in NYC helping my son get his apartment set up. PM was the perfect launch pad. Coffee and croissants in Knave to start the day. Drinks in Knave to recover after all the moving/assembly.

"This was my second desktop PC purchase from PC Specialist, to replace the previous equipment bought from them. I was unsure of the specification I needed, to suit my personal circumstances, so I rang the team and received prompt and helpful advice. The resulting configuration has proved to be exactly what I wanted.
The only minor disappointment was related to the installation, which I paid for. The installer didn't connect the wi-fi aerials provided, and wondered why there was a poor signal to the PC. His main objective seemed to be finishing as soon as possible, and there were a couple of other niggles that I will need to rectify.
However, the equipment is as impressive as I expected.",2

"6 women decided to go to San Francisco and stay at the Marriott in Union Square. We shared rooms, which were spacious and had two double beds in each. Very roomy and comfortable.

"Stayed at this hotel this past weekend during a volleyball tournament at the Convention Center. Hotel was convenient to the convention center but was a little unnerving that we were greeted each evening with a homeless person begging for money by the door to the hotel. Rooms were fine, hotel was clean and nice although the cleaning staff did not clean some of the volleyball girls room for any of the three days we were there. However, the concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending a restaurant when most were booked and in helping us to get a large reservation. This hotel is much much better than the Days Inn Inner Harbor which we stayed at two years ago so I would stay again. But I do think the hotel should do a little more to make their guests feel safe in returning to the hotel and not being accosted by a homeless person. Also, one other complaint: pillows were either the giant decorative pillows or they were extremely small and mushy. Wasn't going to sleep on the big decorative pillows as I doubt they change those cases every night and the other pillows were much smaller than normal and extremely smushy so they were not comfortable to sleep on at all!",2
Beautiful traditional cake,2
"I read this a while back and really enjoyed it. This is firmly in the erotic romance category, so people who are not looking for a very explicit tale will not enjoy this story.""Pearl"" is about a recently married couple. The husband has spent a lot of time at sea and a lot of time exploring his desires. He wants his wife very much, but he presumes she is too much of a lady to enjoy bondage or anything other than the most routine bedroom activities. His wife, having witnessed the games of others, would very much like to branch out, but is unable to communicate this to her husband. Then, there's a business trip, the discovery of a secret room, and the discovery of the discovery of the secret room. Also, the discovery of naughty sketches and the discovery of the discovery -- well, you get it.If you're looking for a short tale with a focus on the erotic between a married couple and containing loving dominance, this would most likely be a worthwhile selection. An excellent choice for when you're not looking for a complicated plot or are overloaded on a lot of serious non-fiction.",2

"This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. Songs on All India Radio, especially Inhi LogoN ne were played so often that I was sick of them at the time, despite recognising their beauty! Yes, it did take all those years to make. This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes, not surprising!! Not only does Meena Kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to Lata's voice. Inhi logoN ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re-recorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development. I only wish someone would find the Ghulam Mohammad songs that weren't included in the film, because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them. Lata in a recent interview (2007) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, apart from Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs, very unusual. There is only a brief shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon. Any other film, this song would have had close-ups of both of them.As for this being the finest film ever, I would beg to differ. It means you have missed a lot of Indian cinema, in no particular order, films like Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay ka Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. etc. And if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from Barsat Ki Raat to Naya Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: the list is really endless!So enjoy Pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above...",2

"A stunningly harrowing account of two soldiers plight in WWII. Set against a freezing backdrop of, not only the fight against the Nazis and traitors in Belorussia, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells a tale of two soldiers of polarized morals, one who survives, but finds it somewhat impossible to deal with his own circumstances, and one who dies, having done all that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break one's spirit, in fact, the ""ascendant"" of the title. A film that should be seen by all, particularly for the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and shuddering set pieces (the incarceration and hanging scenes, in particular. An absolute must see.",2
"Does the job, easy to clean and plugs in!
I’m not a fan of killing to kill or sport so it’s hard for me to even write a review for this. We live in the country, mice are inevitable. They are also very destructive and procreate worse than humans. So I wanted it to be quick and as painless as possible. Not saying this is painless, but there’s no suffering. On that note: I have another brands version and needed a second trap. I chose this one because you can plug it in vs using batteries. It’s easy to clean and fill with pb or whatever you use. The first time it caught a mouse, it continued to beep loudly and the extended sensor light was flashing. After that first one though, I get nothing. No beep or flashing light, hence only 4 stars. I decided not to return because it still does it’s job and that’s all that matters to me. I would buy another one and will in the future.",2
"Excellent everything! This is our new special occasion dinner spot. We arrived at 6:30 on a Sat night with reservations. By 7, the place was packed. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no dress code, so you had people from very casual to business casual. I noticed a few well-mannered young kids around as well. I liked the medium-lit atmosphere and tables were spread out so as not to feel crowded. Even with all tables full and people waiting, the noise level was great. We did not have appetizers, but several were tempting. The mixed green salad was one of the BEST I've ever had. We both got the 9oz bacon-wrapped filet mignon, medium rare, and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The loaded baked potatoes were just the right size and a side of port mushrooms went well with the meal. I can say that the wait-staff and kitchen are VERY efficient, each course coming out immediately after the other. So, if you want a slow casual dining experience, let your wait-staff know to slow things down. For me, our meal was the perfect speed (a little over 1 hour). It was about $90 for our meal + tip, which I felt was a fair value.",2

"The production quality, cast, premise, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) locale and lush John Williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star ""decent"" flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream. The small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at Yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was just a bit too contrived. An illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison.This genre has been more successfully handled by ""Nobody's Fool"" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) ""About Schmidt."" I wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts.I'll give it an ""A"" for effort.",2

"Reddit is one of the basic things on the internet that everyone should, and can be involved in. It is hands down the easiest way to find like minded individuals. Regardless of your interests, you're never alone with reddit. I'd argue it's as important as Google, or Wikipedia. This is one of the easiest ways to navigate it on a mobile device, and it's free. It's maybe not the absolute best, most feature packed reddit app, but it's free and covers the typical user well.",2

"The Olive Tree restaurant really offers great and delicious authentic Indian cuisine.

"My sister travelled from California in May and we stayed with my family in this hotel for two nights. Worth the money, especially in a place as costly as Manhattan. Very friendly staff, clean rooms, decent breakfast, safe and secure. Not forgetting the location - next to Macy's and a few minutes walk from Times Square. No complaints whatsoever for what I paid.",2
Excellent Delivery. Ordered Friday evening and delivered Saturday morning. Grill was fixed for lunch,2
"The food was delicious and we had really good service. I would skip on ordering any of the miso soups. It's about $10 for your usual size bowl and it's nothing spectacular. Everything else we ordered was great and our waiter was extremely polite. A random drunk guy who was also eating at the restaurant came to sit with us and the waiter asked us if we were okay and wanted to know if the guy was bothering us. We let the drunk man be and had our free round of drinks. They also brought out complimentary dessert because my friend was celebrating something special.

"I wish I were rich & powerful because I would most certainly make backroom deals where I kept \""the man down.\"" Where those deals would be made? Smith & Wollensky. This steakhouse epitomizes an old-school, clubby atmosphere where one discusses the latest issue of the New Yorker. Their Las Vegas outpost is an amazing respite from the invasion of over priced, modern fancy steak joints that have become omnipresent on the strip. \n\nWhere to start on what makes Smith & Wollensky great? Ive already touched on the amazing vibe they've created, but the food is just as good. The meat is Prime and cooked expertly. I love that they dont drown their cuts in butter like some other top-end places and they make the meat the real star. Ive had the Bone-In Ribyeye twice now and I can say its nothing short of breathtaking. My associate swears by the Filet Oscar style (how great is it that they still do an Oscar style? Old school, I told you) and judging by the bites I had I concur. The sides are bold yet traditional and complimentary with the rest of the menu. If you're only ordering one, it MUST be the truffle mac & cheese. Thumbs up also to the creamed spinach, hash browns & lobster mashed potatoes. As for starters, I always get their crisp iceberg wedge salad which is the best of any restaurant not named Gibson's in Chicago. Ive never had the deserts there because with all the other food, who can? Judging from the rest of the dining room, it looks like that is a popular sentiment. \n\nThe service is attentive yet unobtrusive. Our waiter Michael knows the menu inside out and was helpful with the wine menu as well. What a treat to have a waiter who treats the food as a passion instead of job. Im sure they other staff our amazing too, but if you can Michael will make your dinner very special in that you wont even realize he made it special. See how that works?\n\nWith all these nice touches comes a hefty price tag, but S & W delivers. Expect that each person will be about $100 bucks with some alcohol. \n\nToo bad the only back-room deals I usually make here is how to get my friend to treat....",2

"Cute cheap wings for costume
I really liked these wings. They were actually much more teal / green than the photo, which was A-ok for me. After about 8hrs of wearing the shoulder straps, they started to bother me a bit. One of the finger elastics came off the wing, but I can sow it back on. I did 'flap around a lot' while wearing them",2
Amazing cus service! Yumma wine. A very talented chef. You can tell a copious amount of love goes into his cheese trays! JUST SAYING!,2
"it was pretty much a home run
I sort of became an instant fan of Kylie Scott after reading Trust and I was super stoked to see what else she had to offer. Chaser was definitely not a disappointment, though to be honest, it was pretty much a home run when I saw that the heroine was pregnant when she meets the hero. I'm basically trash for stories where the male lead is an unapologetic man slut (but not in a bad way), then fights tooth and nail when confronted with the one woman that makes him actually FEEL, and proceeds to fall head over heels for her. That's definitely the case with Eric and Jean and it has the added bonus of him falling in love with her baby as well! The tension that was created because of the contentious relationship between Eric and Nell (which totally made me want/need to read the first two books in the series to get the background on all of that) and between Jean and her parents elevated the book above standard romance fluff. I loved Jean and Eric as characters and their chemistry was just delicious! I can't wait to devour more from Kylie Scott and I hope we get more in the Dive Bar series. 4 out of 5 wine glasses.",2
The front office workers where really helpful. the only thing that I didn't like was that the shower and the sink water was hot NO COLD WATER. we told them and they fix it. But after 40 min the problem came back,2

Loved the place. Superb customer service. Excellent coffee and superb cake mid morning. A great place to chill out int he heat of Kuching,2

"I'm surprised by the low ratings, but then the reviews are either people complaining that it took a while or that it's expensive.\n\nHey, guess what? If you want fast food at cheap prices, there are PLENTY of options in Vegas.\n\nAlas, this is one of the fanciest, most exquisite restaurants in Las Vegas. Beautiful from top to bottom, truly a sexy restaurant. The service is 5-Star. Attentive. Multiple waiters, assistants, and other staff. They are the epitome of professional and know their stuff. \n\nOur party of 6 ordered two whole fish (branzino and john dory) and sure, we added some fresh truffle. Why not? We had than langoustine (AMAZING!), pasta, cured meats, pecorino - most things flown in fresh from Italy that day.\n\nThe wine list was extensive, the cocktails were delicious. The desserts were nice and pretty and tasty.\n\nDinner for 6 with a good amount of wine and several courses and the fresh truffles ran us $2,000.00... and was worth every penny of it. I'm not going to lie, though - I'm glad we were treated :)\n\nAn EXCELLENT restaurant for a special occasion or celebration.",2

"Thought this hotel was in a great location. We stayed in a small suite which was perfect for four, and decently sized for the city. The bar was good, too. My only negative observation? I've never stayed I'm a hotel that seemed to have so few people working...rarely saw a doorman or bellman...never saw more than two people at the front desk...saw one maid...never saw security or any other employees. Odd.",2
"Very nice trip overall. In flight service was friendly and efficient. Food quality well above average, Plenty of legroom and a comfortable seat. The IFE however is fairly awful.",2
"Having first watched the movie at 14, I remember being struck by hearing the word 'govno' (sh*t) for the first time ever on the then-still-Soviet TV (I bet it really was *the* first time in history  anyone wants to add this to trivia section?:)... What an open boldness and freedom, I thought! As years passed, I was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting, but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my 14-y.o. impression: helplessness. There's an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie, of primitive degenerate tide (embodied by Sharikov) sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas... It's a great metaphor of Russian revolution in general, inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to 'upgrade' the lower classes, only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it... An extremely fine and talented piece, wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form. Symbolically enough, the movie itself marked the end of the Soviet movie traditions era before the Hollywood tsunami had knocked them over  for good, it seems, judging by most current Russian movies (most of them labeled 'blockbusters' in prerelease!!! trailers and posters:).Funnily, that 'govno' episode is in no contradiction to Efenstor's comment above re rude language of current generation... From what I've already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this, but it was not. A mild word by current standards, it was way too rude back then, and just rude enough to show the true nature of all Sharikovs... BTW, re Efenstor's lament, it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon, especially for Russian speakers, where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation! But I join in regret that ALL the meaning in today's teenager's talk may be expressed by cusswords. I feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that's most efficient for the task:) Well, this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them, or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it.",2
"The lobby is gorgeous and our room was lovely and quite large. However, every few minutes all day and night we heard beep beep beep from the buses on the street and we were on the seventh floor. It was most annoying. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was large. The hotel staff was extremely helpful. The food from room service was not particularly good, the choices were limited, and it was expensive. The hotel is in a great location. It is across the street from a big shopping complex, Horton Plaza, and within walking distance of great restaurants and night life. The business center at the hotel is expensive, 99 cents to print a page but across the street is a copy, fax, print place where they will print things for 8 cents a page. It is worth the walk. There are not many really nice hotels in downtown San Diego and this hotel is beautiful. Ask for a room that is not on the corner and you may not be bothered by the beeping.",2
"I arrived at the Fairfax after a very long and delayed red-eye flight (false Hurricane warnings. Yuck.). The front desk was amazingly nice and checked me into my room 5 hours early! At that point, I would have been happy with a cot truth be told...but I was so pleased to find out that my room at the Fairfax was a perfect mix of old-school and luxurious comfort. A heavenly bed with Frette sheets and a decadent duvet. Flatscreen tv. And a really nicely appointed bathroom with Frette towels, classy and unique toiletries (which my sister also loved!), and sunken tub.
I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The location couldn't be better. Just a block away from the Dupont Circle metro and the restaurants, but tucked away on elegant Embassy Row. The gym was a little small but perfectly appointed. Everything I needed and free headphones.The business center was also kinda small but had everything that I needed. It was also super nice to use the printer for free.
I can't stress enough how nice the staff were -- thoughtful and charming. (Also they let me checkout 2 hrs late) I really loved my whole stay enormously!",2
i have a feeling that it s been rather popular,2
Lovely food and great service! Will definitely return.,2
"Cheguei pela madrugada em New York, e ao chegar cansado demais ao hotel, uma boa surpresa: era um quarto bem decorado, um bom tamanho, cama king super-hiper-mega-ultra confortável, banheiro com água bem quente (isso pra uma noite de outubro em que faziam 7 graus), e todo o cuidado e atenção que os funcionários podem te dar. No lobby, uma decoração fantástica já denota o que te espera no quarto. Enfim, para mim e minha esposa é quase uma obrigação recomendar este hotel. A localização é maravilhosa: seguindo a 48th (a rua do hotel) sentido oeste, voce chega quase esquina com a Times Square (passa uns 3 quarteiroes, que são pequenos, não se preocupe). Farmácias perto (24hs), bancos, mercadinhos, restaurantes ótimos, metro, rua movimentada, ampla, limpa (o Intercontinental perto da Times Square tem uma rua horrível que fede demais e é estreita). Fica pertinho da Grand Central e do Rockefeller Center, e de outros pontos ótimos. E para um 4 estrelas, o valor é mais do que justo (estamos falando de New York, uma das cidades mais caras do mundo).Não vai querer pagar US$ 200 dolares num 4* em NY,se um 2* cobra 130 (e numa localização duvidavel).",2
"we were there for texas relays, for a place to sleep, only. but i wouldnt ever rent there again. i was afriad to take a shower, or touch any thing in the bathroom. our toliet wouldnt flush the first day we were there, the floor was cracked and so was the bathroom counter. if you have to stay here for some reason id recommend purchasing a pair of flip flops. you wouldnt want to walk on the damp cold, mulit color floor. i didnt know what was on or in it...EW!! never again!!",2
"I have not found a better place for a sandwich yet. The turkey bacon avocado is so good that I think about ordering it the next day while eating it for lunch. The meat is Boar's Head- awesome. The breads are amazing, the sauces are delicious and the side dishes are incredible! There isnt a single thing I have ordered that I didn't like. They don't deliever, but it is worth the drive I assure you. If you are hungry, go there. Right now. Seriously, stop reading and go to Z-Cafe. Order the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Ciabatta. Thank me later =)",2
"OMG! Just what the doctor ordered, elegant, reasonably priced, close to IIT, and free parking! We stayed there when my husband took a weekend accelerated class at IIT. He had class from 9-5 and I wanted to have a mini “get- away.” This place is just what the doctor ordered and included free parking! A good sized room, with a flat screen TV and a 6 ft. soaking tub and soft fluffy towels! The only negative comment is that the room had plastic glasses. It would seem more upscale if there was real glassware or better quality plastic. There’s a great business center and workout room. The housekeeping staff was very accommodating and The Pearl Café offered yummy homemade food!
The manager, Todd Solidy, gave us and extended late check out so that I would not have to wait for my husband in the lobby. This REALLY helped as I was able to have enough time to take another bath in that awesome tub! My husband came home a bit smarter and I came home pleasantly “prune-y!” All in all a great place to stay and we will definitely stay there again!",2

"On the 22nd floor, the view was amazing! I was fortunate enough to get a room with a balcony which added to the beauty. Room was good size and as in previous reviews, came with flat screen TV, small refrigerator, plenty of electrical outlets and bathroom/shower separate from sink area. Housekeeping was on top of everything! Pool didn't open until the last day of my stay and the pool bar still wasn't ready. Renovations seemed really nice though. Lobby bar was, ""the place to be"" after hours. For entertainment though, Gaslamp district is just a short walk away. Best place EVER to party is the 207 at Hard Rock. $20.00 cover charge was the best money I spent while on my trip.Downsides: very little water pressure in the shower, sink and toilet, and food was very expensive. I spend $24.00 on breakfast for one! Drinks in the bar was also expensive as was the internet charge. Overall though, it was a nice stay with more than helpful staff. Alexandria (I think was her name) was the best though. She worked in valet, but was helpful with everything!",2
"I really enjoyed reading this story. Leyland is a photographer on his way to a photo shoot when his car breaks down. He's not just a photographer, though. He's an omega werewolf who knows he's a Tri-Omega, meaning he's fated to have two mates. Imagine his surprise when he discovers both of them on his photo shoot. Jake and Lucas are the Alpha and Beta, respectively, of a very small pack of gay werewolves. These men all have the same background of having been abused and kicked out of their birth packs at an early age for being gay, considered weak or both. Jake and Lucas have been lovers for ten years. Jake recognizes Leyland as his mate and omega but assumes that Leyland, as a human, knows nothing of any of this. Because Jake and Lucas were kicked out of their packs at a young age, much of the werewolf culture is unknown to them so when Leyland announces that they're his mates, he's an omega, and that he'll be mating them both...well, let's just say that shock is the least of the reactions! None of the pack have ever heard of Tri-Omegas so Leyland has his work cut out for him educating everyone on what it means and what his additional powers are. This was a really good start to a new series read for me I have read a few books written by Ms. Glenn I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.",2

"I have no idea what these people are talking about. Everytime I come the food is very good. I started off with there pizza which was good. I then came back and tried the chicken parm and that was excellent (had to add a little salt, but that is better than food being too salty, which is easy to do with Italian food because of the sauce and cheese). I am from NY and a true marinara sauce is suppose to be slightly runny (sauces that you buy in the grocery stores \""ie non runny\"" sauce are NOT AUTHENTIC). The only negative thing; I wish they did not put pizza in the title because they are so much MORE!o See my 2 favorite employees Doug and Aaron!",2

"I think we've stayed in most of the hotels in this area. It's a great location for tourists and business types alike, thanks to subway access and easy walking to midtown attractions. We had a corner room (2405) which was quite large. I like the room. Lighting was adequate. We had a great little loveseat, plenty of space and a full length mirror. The bathroom is nice-ish. Great big tub with a window! You don't see that every day. But the grout was cruddy. And it's mad inconvenient that there are NO hooks to hang your towels. It's pretty unbelievable. We used the one little hook that the hotel robe hangs on for our towels and the maid then left the robe draped over the toilet. Ew. There was a spacious desk and a mini fridge to use. I love that. WiFi worked fine.
The worst part of the hotel is the SLOW elevator. Other guests were complaining about it all the time, too. TWO elevators for 40 floors?? It's crazy and inconvenient. Nothing they can do about it, so just be aware.
Still, it's a nice place with a nice enough lobby, even a bar where we saw some people hanging out for a drink.",2

"This Hotel was a very comfortable and a nice stay. The beds were comfy and the pillows were great. It has a great location near Union Station. The rooftop pool was very nice. My only complaints with this place is that some of the renovations were done poorly. The paint was peeling off the side of the vanity. The windows were tinted and
that was peeling off. The wallpaper was peeling also. I don't know if all rooms were that way. I didn't effect my stay. The elevator door was painted and scratched up. I would call whoever did the renovations and have them fix there shoddy work.",2
We stayed at the Westin at the Domain in Austin several weeks ago and it was great. The room was comfortable and the staff was more than helpful. We utilized the golf cart shuttle to access the large shopping area across the street and it was very much a plus to have. Would definitely stay there again!!,2
"Another great experience at Hotel 31. You couldn't ask for a nicer staff or for a more quaint, historical hotel stay. They were very accomodating, friendly, helpful -- I love this place and will go back again next summer. The quaint atmosphere of this hotel is so charming and the price cannot be beat. Always a pleasure to stay here, right in the middle of the city, and enjoy ourselves without having to worry about breaking the bank to stay somewhere clean and safe.",2
"Good product.
It is well made and I am sure will be useful.",2
"Clearly, this hotel is not what can be considered ""state of the art"". While OK for travelrs who work in the financial district, for others it's a bit far from the rest of the nicer sights of Boston.
Basically, old elevators and rooms are a bit dark with almost no view, but nice big TVs. In front of my room was a vewry noisy ice-maker... not nice. Also, one of the handles on my closet was broken off and the closet and door were always ""stuck"" making the whole thing seem rather ""improvised"".
Overall, I would say this is a ""3+ star hotel"" rather than a 4 star one. Compliment to the staff though... very friendly and helpful. Excellent.
The elevators are ancient and slow... definite need of an upgrade.",2
"Perfect location and beautiful hotel.
May 2004. Needs a good breakfast place nearby--only downfall.",2
Please thank the entire staff at the hotel for a job well done last Thursday (9/8/11) during the massive power outage. The hospitality and level of service was absolutely outstanding. I felt very lucky to have been a guest at your hotel that particular evening.,2
"Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry.",2

"The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken Americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans. The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so. You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. I just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact American indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!",2

"We've all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc. but none of them can stand up to GE007. The game itself is great. I have literally burned out my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT. This game along alone built the mold that is essential for all modern shooters. on top of that the multi-player is great. The Story mode itself is worth playing a hundred times over and more. Its a great game for when your board and you want to just shoot up some people and there are endless unlock ables. (cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, god knows how many Multiplayer charries, and the three difficulties as well as the famous '007' difficulty Our modern games are great but when you sit down and play this game you get a certain feeling that few other games can give you. And with the Online capabilities of newer shooting games we rarely see this old two on two death match style. and when we do its no where near as good as this games. And when you get bored of the story, there are endless mysteries, glitches and easter eggs to be found and taken advantage of. This is definitely one of the greatest shooting games of all time.",2
Straight forward process and paid promptly,2
"The Marriott Courtyard Soho will never be forgotten for myself and a load of other travelers as this place was our refuge during hurricane Sandy. Even before the hurricane hit I was impressed with the hotel and especially the staff. The hotel is super clean, its close to the Subway, the amenities are on par with other Courtyards and its quaint enough to feel less like a Marriott chain and more at home in NYC. I checked in early and got one of the only rooms available, 901 to be exact and the view was not good, actually it was terrible but this is NY and you should always expect a really great view or a terrible one. I suggest asking for any room other than one ending in ""01"".
The reason I give this hotel a 5 star rating is the staff. I was always greeted with a smile and a can do attitude by the staff. Myself like so many other guest were unable to get out of NY so we had no choice but to ride out the storm. The hotel prepared well for the massive hurricane and they handled the situation very well in my opinion. We were always kept abreast of the situation and they prepared all the guest rooms for a loss of power, which did happen. They even prepared a dinner buffet for the guest the night the hurricane hit - free of charge. After the storm had passed, the power was in no way coming back on anytime soon so the hotel hired cars (not taxis) and transported all the guest to different Marriott properties that still had power – all free of charge. They also made sure our rates were honored at the other hotels. It was a welcome gesture and the staff from the manager to the housekeepers were just great in being positive and helpful through a very bad situation.",2
"Everyone was so welcoming and friendly with the personal touch. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were very clean, the beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was lovely with all the marble. The power shower was just what was needed, with the temperature being in the 90's. The complimentary breakfast in the Abbocato was delicious and the service there was first-class as well. I am planning a return trip as soon as possible and would rather stay there again instead of anywhere else.",2
"Can imagine it being any cheaper
amazing tech for the price... this unit opens up the opportunities of applications for use of hardware..... Amazing all this tech and potential for less then 15 bucks",2

Comfortable and fits well. Would buy again!",2
Just moved near by and had to check this place out.\n\nWe were sad to leave the area near Tokyo Lobby in Glendale which had great sushi but Yellowtail will be the new spot for us.\n\nService -\n We felt like we were friends at the restaurant not just customers. Service was great!\n\nFood was as good as it gets -\n We had the Teppan Chicken and it was just as good if not better than the many teppanyaki places around town. You don't get the fun show but the food is VERY tasty! We also tried the White Tuna sushi and OMG roll. Both were gone in minuets.\n\nAtmosphere - \n The atmosphere was the perfect blend between Fancy Sit Down and Family Friendly.\n\nWe will be back very soon to our new local sushi sopt!,2

"Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.",2

"Typical business hotel, close to the airport with everything you expect from the Marriott chain.
Especially liked the fact that the gym is open 24/7, the swimming pool has more limited opening hours (but still extensive). Breakfast buffet was a bit minimalistic but that was compensated by the different breakfast items you could order as well.",2
"The suite was perfect so that the 2-year old could sleep in the bedroom and we could do things in the living room. PROS: Full-size crib that seemed quite comfortable for the 2-year old, lots of room, lots of kid-friendly restaurant options nearby (including Shake Shack, Blue Smoke and others), Whole Foods also a few blocks away. CONS: The sliding doors between the bedroom and the living room didn't insulate much noise, the lights and TV automatically turn on when someone enters the room (even if one of us was in the room), which had the potential to wake up the sleeping 2-year old.",2
I was delightfully surprised by the southern comfort food and hospitality. I especially devoured the BBQ pork chop. The staff is friendly and foodie savvy. Get extra napkins... Or just lick your fingers. It's that delicious. Seriously addictive!,2

"I've been going to Lifequest for several years now. I went in because I had carpal tunnel so bad it was debilitating. I could barely work. Even brushing my hair could shoot pain down my arms. I didn't even consider the neck and back pain that I had when I went in. Just thought that was normal.\nAfter an initial period of frequent visits to fix everything, I now just go there every other week for maintenance. It feels so good to take care of myself. The staff is great, and they also have a few massage therapists in office.",2
"Stayed three nights. The location can't be beat, and the room prices were reasonable for NYC. I was impressed that the room was so large--we had two adults and two teenagers, so I was worried we'd be in a shoebox-sized room (as so often happens in New York). The hotel is large, bustling, and feels safe--you must show a room key to get in at night. As a native New Yorker who returns to the city to visit friends and be a tourist, I'd be happy to stay there again.",2
No need to write long. Went to Cedar on 15 for Valentine and all was absolute fabulous!! Very nice view and outstanding food!!,2

This place is a great home base for touring Boston. You are walking distance from most of the historic sites and it is very close to the shopping district. The service is impeccable. Jonathan and the concierge staff were amazing. There is a car available for transport as well and the drivers are very professional and helpful as well. We would definitely stay here again when returning to the area.,2

"My family and I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago and we had no complaints. The lobby was huge. Our corner room was perfect - pretty large with a comfortable chaise lounge. I loved the bathroom with the carrara marble sink and the fridge came in handy to store our leftovers from the Riverwalk restaurants (""Boudros"", etc.). The hotel was in the perfect location, near the Riverwalk and not too far from the Tower of the Americas. We walked everywhere. The pool was very relaxing. We got free internet in the lobby. Definitely, would stay here, again, as we really enjoyed our stay.",2

"This was our second stay at The Legacy Golf Resort. Our first was nine years ago for the Fiesta Bowl. On that occasion we had a one-bedroom King suite, and based on that stay, we chose The Legacy for our stay for the National Championship game. Although we had a King-Studio suite this stay, the room was just as comfortable. The washer and dryer in the room were an unexpected bonus, the mini-fridge was larger than expected, and the bathroom had two vanities, one inside the bathroom/shower area, and one in an alcove adjacent to the bathroom. The balcony was great, and even though we chose not to upgrade to the golf course view, it was still quiet and pretty. One medium-size criticism is the noise from the heater/ air conditioning unit. It was pretty noisy. A light sleeper will be woken up any time it turns on. The only nitpicky criticisms I have are these: The information on how to use the phones was outdated; the room guide and telephone both said to push the messages button to retrieve your messages, however, you actually had to dial a number that you could only find if you called the front desk and asked for it. The other super-nitpicky thing is the shower door arrangement. The glass doors had an knob on one door to slide it open from the inside, but if you opened that door, you stepped out between the toilet and the tub, not at the other end, where the actual exit is. As I said, those are really nitpicky things, and the location, near baseline, easy access to freeways but with a tucked away oasis feel to the resort more than made up for it. Staff was always friendly and helpful, rooms were very clean, and resort was well maintained. Quick tip: From car rental area of Sky Harbor, get to Sky Harbor Circle, and look for I-10 East/Tuscon. The exit to 32nd is easy to find once you're on I-10.",2

We flew from Heathrow via San Paulo to Lima and returned via Madrid to Heathrow during a package holiday to Peru and I have to say having read some of the reviews that we had very pleasant flights. The planes seemed new to me were clean and comfortable and the food not bad for airline food. I was expecting the worse but all the tit bits I took just in case were not needed. We even had snacks on the internal flights and free drinks so can't complain. However I would advise taking your own supply of water as once dinner had been served and the lights dimmed for the over night flight we saw no sign of the cabin staff until breakfast. The staff never cracked a smile though I can't say they were unhelpful they just didn't seem particular keen and friendly. The only time we saw a smile is when they asked an elderly lady to move seats and then promptly sat an off duty air hostess in the vacated seat because there was an empty seat alongside! A lesson learned if I'm asked to move seats I want to know why I wouldn't mind for a family to be together but not for cabin crew to have a better seat. Saying all that I would fly TAM again! I have certainly flown in better but I have also flown worse so if cost is an issue or its part of a holiday package then don't worry too much. Happily our luggage was fine by the way even though we had connecting flights. Once checked in at Heathrow and on our return at Lima we didn't see it again until the end of flights.,2

"Recently, my husband, parents and I had the pleasure of staying at the Loews Hotel-Denver. The hotel is located in the upscale Cherry Creek area and convenient to downtown and the airport. Our stay was excellent except for 1 minor hiccup which was quickly remedied by one dedicated front desk staff member, Sergey T.
When we had originally booked our stay, the booking agent at the time had informed us that each room would be receiving complimentary breakfast as well as a great discounted promotional rate the hotel was offering. Given that this hotel is so highly rated and in an upscale part of town, we were overjoyed with the savings.
Upon a very late night arrival (due to a delayed flight), we were very pleased to see that the hotel is as lovely and deluxe as other reviewers commented. The ambiance is very high-end and luxurious with granite/marble floors and an Italian villa-style decor. The staff members in reception were helpful and very courteous even at such a late hour!
When they ran over the charges however, the complimentary breakfast was not mentioned as part of the reservation. They proceeded to inform us that the situation would be handled the next day after a good night's rest.
It was a restful night indeed with the large and comfortable bed and well-appointed room with great amenities. The following morning when we came to speak to reception, we were met by a different staff member, Sergey T. who went above and beyond to see what could be done about the complimentary breakfast discrepancy. After reviewing the situation, Sergey proceeded to honor the complimentary breakfast even though it had mistakenly been mentioned to us by the original booking agent and was, in fact, for another separate promotion the hotel was also offering. We were subsequently seated in the hotel's restaurant where we all indulged in a top-notch and delicious breakfast of omelets, fresh fruit, teas and a pretty darn good espresso!
What could have been an uncomfortable situation was so easily and expertly handled by Sergey. Kudos to the Loew's hotel for such a pleasant and caring staff.
We will definitely be returning to the Loew's hotel in Denver!",2

"I enjoyed hearing about epidemiology, but didnt find the quizzes very useful. I was expecting more practice doing computation or examining case studies. The lectures also had no time in between slides to pause, write notes, and make sure I understood what was just said. I liked that the lectures were well organized and the review questions in between the topics of discussion.",2
"Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the silent-film comedians. Why is he utterly forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the Fox warehouse burnt in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; nor was he dapper, like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try for audience sympathy.However, his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilarious today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he asked Chaplin if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever envied, and Chaplin instantly named Lloyd Hamilton. The character most frequently portrayed by Hamilton on screen -- a flat-capped naff, with fastidious hand gestures and a duck-like walk -- was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father), and further adapted by Jackie Gleason as his 1950s TV character 'The Poor Soul'.'The Movies', directed pseudonymously by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's hilarious. We first see him as a country boy, bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage, on his way to the big city. Then he steps away from the cottage, and we see that it's IN the big city, with traffic booming all round him!Eventually, our hero ends up at a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the Montmartre Cafe in downtown L.A.) where all the movie actors eat between takes. There's an amusing gag when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. Finally, our lad seats himself at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity. Sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There's a very well-made double-exposure shot -- the join is nearly invisible -- when Lloyd Hamilton as himself greets Lloyd Hamilton as the country boy.Sadly, Hamilton's peak period of creativity was very brief. He began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act (Ham and Bud, opposite Bud Duncan), and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period. Sound movies were not kind to Hamilton, and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'The Movies' is quite funny, and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians' style. I'll rate it 7 out of 10.",2
"Stayed 1 night with the family. Great location near Chinatown, Reading Terminal Market & downtown. Room was clean & well appointed, beds comfy, check in/out was quick & the people at the front desk were courteous & helpful. And the area is safe to walk around at night. The buffet breakfast was definite plus. Typical menu of eggs, potatoes, waffles, fruit, etc. Kids enjoyed the indoor pool & hot tub, another reason we chose this hotel. Did the self parking option, which was in a small lot a 1/4 block up the street, very convenient, paid $25 which is average for overnight parking in the city. Overall, a nice hotel, good value, great location, would stay there again with no hesitation.",2
"I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film. I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film. This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interesting. When he said his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I'd seen on DVD a week prior, I decided I had to go and check it out. The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing. Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy, he's always running one way or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up, young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, crafts wonderfully honest characters, and has them do completely believable things. As far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic one, it is very close.",2

"I first took this course when I was at the height of my frustration over learning Nihongo in Osaka. During that time, I had been studying almost everyday for 11 months. I was constantly reading, reviewing, and answering exercises. I often studied until I was too tired to study any more, and yet I could retain the information only for a while. The way I was studying wasnt working for me, and I wanted to know how I can study and learn more effectively. A month after I started taking this course and applying some of the techniques presented in it, I noticed that I was able to remember more of my Nihongo lessons. I actually spent less time studying, but I think that, with the techniques I was using, I was studying in a smarter, more effective, and more efficient way... I continue to apply these techniques in relevant situations in my life now. I also review this course every once in a while. Each time, I find that I still learn something from it. Thank you so much to everyone who came together to make this course possible!",2

"We made our reservation for Parent's Weekend at USC in August, for a hotel stay the end of October, 2011. When we arrived, our confirmed king room reservation was unavailable, as they had booked a convention in the meantime, and the king rooms were all taken. We were given a room with 2 double beds despite showing our printed confirmation dated almost 3 months previously for a king room. The front desk clerk was totally unapologetic and literally shrugged us off in an uncaring manner. Our room was facing a parking lot, where there was live music until the wee hours of the morning....very noisy, despite the very loud AC unit under the window. The bed had a very deep ""sink-hole"" in the middle, and needed a new mattress desperately. All in all, I would have expected a lot more from having read previous reviews. The only pluses were the in-room coffee maker, which was a Keurig with a very nice selection of teas/coffees, and even hot cocoa pods available in the lobby, as well as the rainmaker shower head and very nice shower. It is right across the street from the Staples Center, though, so the location is convenient. Also across the street was a restaurant called ""The Farm"" which served awesome blueberry pancakes!
However, a bad night's sleep tends to negate all those pluses. We would not stay there again.",2

But i wish the author would have filled in a few more details and did a bit more with the story line as well.

"If given the option, we stay at Renaissance hotels. This hotel wasn't as nice as other Renaissance hotels. No complaints because the price was terrific, but I would look at other hotels before booking this one, because there are cheaper w/ = quality. The rooms are small (bathrooms are nice size). The lobby was nice, the front desk was friendly. However, the rooms reminded me of a renovated Crowne Plaza. The beds are comfortable, but I wasn’t impressed with the pillows. We always get upgraded, but didn’t here. We ordered room service one night and only one meal out of three was correct, when you are ordering a $12 grilled cheese, you expect perfection :-) The pool area was nice, but the hot tub didn’t have enough water and it took well over hours upon reporting to get filled, I don’t even know how long because we didn’t stay any longer. In short, I would recommend this hotel to a friend if it was the right price, but there are other hotels I would first recommend. The location is okay, but I have enjoyed other locations more too. You might not be disappointed, but there are better deals out there. Oh, and parking is $49 per night.",2

"This was my first visit following recent refurbishment. The magnificent setting - the pool, pond, gardens, and swans remain untouched - provide an oasis of calm with LA just outside your door. I had booked a five day stay through WhataHotel, which came with the added bonus of a continental breakfast, although no room upgrade was offered.The newly styled interiors are superb, with beautiful and thoughtful design features providing elegant, modern luxury. The rooms are very well finished with heated floors in the bathrooms (although surprisingly not in the loo), B&O TV's, La Prairie soaps,superb linens and fluffy robes. Although some die-hards may prefer the old club style bar, it too is now lighter and far less stuffy. The ballroom would make a wonderful spot for any celebration. There's a new spa and gym, both state of the art; although the gym could offer several sizes of Swiss ball, and also make sure there are plenty of clean headsets! The staff were apparently all replaced (except 11) after the two year shutdown; the new waitstaff, bellboys, and cleaners are all wonderful, where you're really made to feel extremely welcome. A small niggle - some of the day to day restaurant managers could be more client focussed; on several occasions it took far too long to get seated for breakfast or dinner.
Wolfgang Puck's restaurant is still settling in; the food is competent, although a little more innovative menu will be required if the restaurant is to receive many star accolades. At the prices charged for dinner there were surprisingly no ameuses bouches on starting dinner, or extras around dessert. There's a great wine list, if you have a reason to celebrate, with knowledgeable sommeliers. The house white, a Gruner Veltliner, offers the best value.
All in all, this is a unique hotel, with a great provenance, now brought in to the 21st century.
With a little attention to some of the teething issues above, the hotel will retain its position amongst the top 2-3 hotels in the US. I can't think of a better choice if relaxation is what's called for.",2

"The hotel is in what I feel is the perfect location to explore San Francisco. It's a 5 minute walk or less to the Ferry Building, BART, Busses and Cable Car stop. Downtown shopping, museums and restaurants are easily accessed via a ""flat"" walk or public transportation. This is also true for walking to North Beach and Fishermans Wharf and the assorted Piers. It's a bit of a walk (less than 1 1/2 miles) to these areas but great if the weather permits and you're up for it.
Regarding the hotel itself we were very pleased. We got a great rate ($130.00/night) on Hotwire and were placed in what many have referred to as the ""older"" section of the hotel on the 9th floor. The rooms were large, clean and well maintained. The bathroom is fairly small and the amenities fairly limited but this is a solid 4 Star property. Check-in could not have been easier. We actually arrived at 12:30 pm and were immediately assigned a room. The whole process took about 5 minutes or less. Every staff person we came into contact with treated us with respect and kindness. We would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel and the area it is located in. One final note: Yes the area has its complement of homeless, urban ""character"" types but at no time did we feel unsafe. These types of individuals are found in every city I have ever visited. The noise factor also wasn't a problem. It's there but not terribly bothersome.",2

"Awesome show. Had a great time and kept us laughing the whole time and definitely kept us amazed. Penn & teller engaged the audience as well in various tricks. I won't say much about the performance because I don't want to give anything away, but it is definitely a must see show while in Vegas.",2
i got up at the wrong side of bed this morning weird how that can happen when one side of my bed is facing the wall and the other side is the only side to get out and am was feeling a bit naughty,2
"Dieses Hotel liegt super zentral und hat gleich neben an eine Metrostation. Vom Zimmer aus hatten wir sogar ein Times Square View! Die Gegend ist aber sehr, sehr teuer! Wer zentral wohnen möchte, der muss das natürlich in kauf nehmen. Im Hotel selber muss man alles extra zahlen. Auch die Kofferaufbewahrung, wenn das Zimmer z.B. noch nicht fertig ist. Internetzugang ist auch teuer. Ich kann das Hotel aber weiter empfehlen. Es ist zentral und sauber.",2
i am so impressed and feeling fantastic,2
"The location is great.
The hotel employees were gracious and welcoming. The concierges were very helpful.
A room service order of coffee came with unrequested croissants and mango juice.
The corner room was clean except for some very obvious carpet stains that should be cleaned.
The bed is very comfortable.
We definitely recommend this hotel.",2
i head off to bed i feel content and happy to be where i am at in life currently,2
"I will preface with this: I am a fan of Omni Hotels. Have stayed at 15-20 of them over the years and nearly every one is deserving of at least 4-diamond status. The Shoreham is no exception. I just LOVE the historic properties and this one fits the bill. You know you are in a special place when you first walk in to that lobby. Expansive without feeling like a Hyatt, classic and comfortable. Lots of people ""hanging out"" in the lobby, too, which is nice.
I used the Omni self check-in and it worked like a charm. My key was waiting for me upon arrival at the little box next to the front desk...I walked directly to my room. The room was beautiful and full of modern touches, yet historic. If you want brand-new construction, obviously there are better choices for you. I'll keep the old classics.
Sam Petty in sales/reservations helped me with my booking a couple of months before my arrival and I can't say enough about him. He's a real asset to Omni.
Location is superb, too, with the Woodley Park Metro just a block away. Since the hotel is near the National Zoo, there are lots of kids, especially in the summer. This didn't bother me and I found the hotel to be very quiet.
My only ""complaint"" is that this old hotel doesn't have a lot of elevator shafts. It can take a few minutes.
Overall, bravo to the Shoreham and her staff. Well done.",2
"Good music, reasonable pricing. Good decor, only the service was slow as the staff were busy enjoying the band...",2
The e-commerce giant just completed an exciting stock split. But that's not the only reason to hop on board.,2
"Amazon started Thursday delivering packages in more than a dozen cities using the custom electric van built by Rivian. The initial rollout, which kicks off in Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Nashville, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, and St. Louis, will eventually spread to more than 100 cities by the end of the year, Amazon said.",2
"Protection
The comfort and the protection my son likes",2
Becca did an amazing job helping me find a house in a tough market. Becca went above and beyond and even came with me on New Year's Eve to sign an offer! I would highly recommend her!!,2
i feel like i didnt do enough summer things to counteract the less than perfect summer weather,2
"Nandos was by far my favorite chain restaurant in Europe. The butterfly burger was amazing, as I had one in the London, Dublin, and Edinburgh location. A must have if visiting!",2
"PROS:
2 minute walk from Downtown Crossing.
Free internet access.
Rooms clean and comfortable.
Staff friendly and efficient.
Seperate pub & restaurant on site - ""The Elephant & Castle"".
CONS:
Bathroom tiny.
No sound proofing between rooms, it is possible to hear the television in the room next door.
The attached pub / restaurant is extremely busy and crowded with after work socialisers.
OVERALL:
A good experience and for the price, we would definitely stay again.",2
Had a dinner here with a few friends and teacher. The food is delicious with interesting presentation. The service is good too. Will surely recommend friends to come here.,2
I called around town and no one could give me final price. They advertise $99 any for room and then final price for house $300-500 . Mr champion was able give price out door w/ no surprise . I call on Friday and Sunday he was on time. After our walk through he got equipment ready and I left the house to pick up my kids while he work. It took about 3hrs for 1360sq house not bad. The carpet look brand new after 6 years living there.,2
"Nous sommes all\u00e9es \u00e0 la Croissanterie aujourd'hui. Moi, j'ai pris un croissant et je ne regrettait pas mon choix. Les croissants se fondent dans la bouche! Le caf\u00e9 \u00e9tait bon, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Mon chum a pris un burger qui le trouvait bon aussi. La serveuse \u00e9tait gentille et souriante. Mais, je crois qu'il faut l'aller pour les croissants!",2
Download option shouldn't be a premium offer. It's free on Meta. It should be free on the Town square of the world app.,2
"We stayed at the Red Roof for five nights from December 2nd and we were very pleasantly surprised. The rooms were nicely decorated with good sized clean bathroom. Rooms were equipped with Iron/ironing board and a coffee maker. The breakfast room on the second floor provides bagels, toast, muffins and tea/coffee. Maid service is every day. The room itself is not very big but if there are no seats available you can take your food to your room. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. There is a girl at a special help desk in reception from 8am to 8pm each day. The location is perfect with Macys and the Empire state building just around the corner. Also wilthin walking distance is Time Square. Cafe Martinique on Broadway is good value for hot breakfast, lunch and dinner. Overall the Red Roof was an added bonus for our first trip to New York.",2
"No words, I have used a lot of music streaming apps but still Spotify is far better. Only problem with this app in my opinion is, The amount of ads are too much it would be better if the amount of ads are lesser and we can enjoy music more freely. Anyways, Thank you Spotify!♡",2
"The place is just amazing. Every single thing is worth the 5 stars:⭐The most authentic and delicious Moroccan food you’ll try outside of Morocco. We tried different things, all of them were delicious. Anything you try will be",2
"My husband and I brought my mom to the Drake in March of '08 to celebrate her 60th birthday. The great thing about The Drake during the winter, is you're able to get fantastic rooms for unbelievably reasonable prices. I believe our two club-level rooms overlooking Lake Michigan were less than $200 a night.
The rooms were de rigeur for the Drake - well appointed and ample in size. We love staying at the Drake for the ""old Chicago"" feel we always get, but are always shocked back into Hilton reality when it comes to service. Most of the Drake employees always seem rather put out, and the biggest example was when the three of us (rather than venture out into the freezing snow) opted to have dinner and drinks in the Palm Court. Our waitress literally had a scowl on her face every time we asked her for something. I'm not a travel snob, but I'm never a fan of servers just being downright rude to people who actually, are quite nice and friendly. The tip we left reflected our dissatisfaction.
But, we don't go to the Drake for the service, we go for the history and the fun and the location on Michigan Avenue.",2
"We stayed here upon the recommendation of friends who visit NYC often, and we will thank them for the tip. We very much enjoyed this property -- great location, so convenient to 5th Ave, Times Sq, Rockefeller Ctr, and in a quieter area than other hotels. The staff was friendly and attentive, and rapidly took care of any issues that arose. We love the extra amenities like morning beverage service and free wi-fi that come with signing up for Omni's free loyalty program, Select Guest. The room was spacious, even with the rollaway for our teenager. The restaurant was good without being overly formal or pricey. Loved that we could get a light dinner in a very comfortable lounge-like setting. We will definitely stay here again, as well as at other Omni hotels.",2
"GA863 from Sorong to Jakarta on the early morning flight. Check in at Sorong was a little chaotic as there are only two queues and quite a few passengers checking in, however the flight took off on schedule. Onboard the cabin crew service was very good, they did offer me a meal, however I chose to go for a few snacks instead. Through out the flight the cabin crew kept coming around offering soft drinks and snacks. Arrival in Jakarta was only slightly behind schedule by a few minutes, however it took my baggage approx. 20 minutes to come out, which really is not bad for a busy time of the morning. Overall good service.",2
i feel even more determined to stay on it and stay focused because i am so close to a goal,2
thanks you meta Facebook.,2
Good Service app,2
"When searching in Yelp for a pharmacy nearby during our stay I found this was the closest to us but noted the reviews were not so good. Nothing could be further from the experience we had... Went the first time on the day we arrived and swear we were back for one thing or another every day after that. The manager was super friendly and helpful during a return we made of a faulty product and remembered and greeted us personally every time we walked in, cashier staff were the nicest ever and even the pharmacy staff were extremely amicable, professional and funny amidst a somewhat uncomfortable situation that came up with our doctor's office. Great selection of products and fantastic costumer service will make this our neighborhood pharmacy when in town!",2
Love the $ 1 ice cream when checking out.....found great deals!!!!,2
One word: SERVICE!!!!! \n\nThis hotel has got it goin on! Not only are the rooms beautiful and the hotel super clean with a fabulous atmosphere ... The staff ... Everyone from the bell guys to the dealers to the bartenders .... Are absolutely world class in the service industry. \n\nThey're not just helpful. They go out of their way. \nIf you ask where a restaurant is ... They don't just point and give directions ... They walk you there! It's above and beyond and it absolutely makes a difference. \n\nFood an drinks have also been awesome in every restaurant we've tried. \n\nGo Cosmo! Keep up the awesome work and I certainly won't be staying anywhere else in Vegas!,2
"I was booked right in front of the toilet and up above is the toilet sign light. When I realised it, I was not very comfortable with it because it is a long flight and might disturb my sleep when guests are walking in and out of the toilet but I didn't say anything to the attendant. The flight attendant realised this and immediately suggested to me that there are some empty seats that I could make myself more comfortable. She showed me to the empty seats and ask if I wanted to change and would do all the arrangements for me. I made the change and was very pleased and thankful to the flight attendants, especially Ms Tseng who saw through all my needs throughout my flight.",2
i was one ill always remember while difficult and exhausting it was beautiful and left me feeling pretty satisfied,2
"Hotel bien placé : à côté de Central Park, 15 minutes à pied de Times Square etc ....
Tres bon rapport qualité/prix.
Piscine sur le toit (rare)
Certes hotel un peu vieillot mais pour ce prix, difficile de trouver aussi bien à NYC.
Pour le petit dej allez sur la 9 av (3 minutes à pied) il y a plein de possibilités bien moins cher que à l'hotel !!",2
It's amazing I love to listen to all my favorite podcasts 9/10,2
I like this We 🥰,2
Staff knowledgeable and very helpful. Quick delivery.,2
"The Beguiled is one of those under-seen films in the careers of a director &/or actor that ends up playing better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama set in Civil War era Confederacy country. It's almost a 180 from what 'Harry' had for audiences. Here is a film that is under the radar, and with a low-budget to almost no business when compared with what Dirty Harry pulled in. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded in a world full of dangerous men but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. And there's even romance in it in between some of the rougher and more complex scenes. But in this kind of framework to make the film, Siegel therefore actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that roams into something more European; I'm reminded here and there of Polanski's work in the 60's. It all works though pretty well even with the initial doubt that these two figures of masculine film-making (Eastwood the obvious and Siegel having made his niche in B-noir and low-budget thrillers) can pull off material that could possibly be made for a Lifetime movie.It was also captivating and really darkly comic here and there to see Eastwood's performance working off of these girls. He's doing something a little subversive in his performance by still having the sort of Eastwood machismo- if there is such a thing close to his clichéd movie image- by being a step ahead of this little school for young women at times and not at others. To see Eastwood in a performance like this, as with Play Misty for Me (the other Eastwood work of 1971), shows how cool he can act believably with very good actresses. Particularly here are the four main female characters, each of varying ages and each with varying attractions to their 'Yankee' man. While Siegel's work directing all of the actors has its moments in the first half it's really once the story crosses the half-way mark in the dream sequence (less successful than the director could be capable of) that the real juicy scenes start to pick up. A lot of this is the best that Siegel directed dramatically, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where not expected.It's a difficult film, all of this praise aside, as it doesn't paint anyone as being too respectable- only the character of Hallie the slave on duty played by Mae Mercer is sort of separated from what transpires between the all-too-curious women and McBurney. Along with this, Eastood here is acting in a role that is and isn't what he's usually seen as during this time of his true formative years in the movies. He's an anti-hero here, which was his trademark of the westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. But unlike those films he's not really in a mode where he's 'larger than life', to put it in a way, as he is both deserter and womanizer, deceiver and tricky even in his most charming and affable moments. If it's not one of his best acting jobs, which is hard to really put together considering his catalog, it is one that is worth a look for fans who might want to see another side of him. It's a credit to him, but also to what clicked with his collaborations with Siegel, as they both took chances at this time in Hollywood.",2

I liked it, but I'm the grandmother...We'll see how it goes for our 7 year old granddaughter at Christmas!",2
"Scott was our driver for an evening on the town with my wife. He was extremely professional. We had the stretched lincoln limo. It was very professional inside. Nothing crazy like flashing lights or strobes going on. It was the perfect ride for a lovely evening with my wife.\n\nWhat was also nice was that the driver wasnt chatty at all. He allowed us to enjoy the ride, as he took us to our destinations. He was a complete gentleman the entire time. He put the divider up the minute we told him where we were off too. Too many times drivers leave this down and start being chatty. Just do what your supposed to do and drive us! :) \n\nI would definately use them again or recommend them. They did have a few other cars as well including a Chrystler 300 with all the stroby lights and neon for proms and such, a fleet of town cars and buses all for rental.\n\nI am glad I chose Accent Limos. They made the night perfect!",2
"When you go out of your way to get something, you know it's better than good. \n\nI will go out of my way to get a cup of their Strawberry-Mint-Basil gelato. You should too.",2
"Works well if done right
I’ve been needing a bra to wear with my backless Maxi dress. I’ve tried countless brands and they’ve never lived up to the type . This Bra is a bit tricky but with some trial and error I was able to get this to stay on! Make sure you wash and dry your body before use. Please note that it is not seamless ! You can gently wash it with soap and water to reuse it.",2
The staff here is friendly and efficient. They literally take care of everything for you when it comes to packaging your items and getting them sent off! This will definitely be my go to place from now on for all of my shipping needs.,2
i feel strong and accomplished from being here doing this and i can honestly say it changed my life,2
"I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class. Were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality(of the product). I did rent this one back in the eighties and I remember it to be good(but not great)movie. I've always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was a perfect fit for the movie.I am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I grant you yes it's no Oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary. From what I've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time.Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They perhaps made the company above all else. Where American workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate email over that comment I'm sure.Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered. Rather as one character in the movie put it ""it was the dealers(meaning car dealer) problem"".Many of these things are probably dated but I'm sure some are still around as many US car makers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American, European and Japanese automakers I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period. The book is called ""The machine that changed the world"" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers. Parts are bit dry but I think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also.",2
"We recently stayed with this hotel , upon departing for a first time cruise. From the moment i called they really made you feel welcome , They also helped us set up transportation each way. Our rooms were ready upon arrival , Very nice rooms . The breakfast was like any other continental (good). Location was good wasnt far to walk anywhere really. We were with 3 other couples for a 25th & 65th anv. braught champaighn to the rooms. Everyone & I mean everyone really made you feel like you were home ~ I would most deffinately return to the pioneer square hotel our next visit to Seattle!!!!",2
the place that make you food sense higher. delicate dishes with reasonable price.,2
"If your a major foodie and looking for an out of the ordinary dining experience then you NEED to check this place out. I went late and it was not too crowded, the service was basically on the spot, the bone marrow and duck wing were exceptional, and if your a dog person the patio is dog friendly (added bonus for my two dogs the bone that the marrow is served in is dog safe). I have not found food like this in the area and its definitely worth trying.",2
"I just don't understand the less than stellar reviews of this Hand and Stone. I have been receiving massages for over 3 years from various therapists. Certainly I had a preference for some over others, but that is human nature. I have always found the front desk personnel to be friendly and polite, either when I call for appointments or am at the desk asking questions. We moved and other places are closer but we wouldn't think of going anywhere else.",2
"I read up on the previous reviews for Renee and decided to take a chance. I am so glad that I did because this is the best haircut I've had in what seems to be an eternity. Renee understood exactly what I wanted, took her time like a good artist, and engaged in a pleasant conversation throughout the appointment. Overall it was an excellent experience and I plan on continuing with her from this point forward. Given the outcome, I feel like the price was very reasonable. I highly recommend Renee to anyone who is looking for a new hairdresser.",2

"i still can't belive that starevich made this film back in 1934. animation is simply perfect, and what is amazing about it, with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one. it has everything: a great story, beautiful chracters (although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects... well, it is definitely not a kid's movie,but it's a must-see for anyone seriously interested in animation.",2
"As always Singapore Airlines does a great job. From the hot towels when you board to the choice of entertainment there was not a fault. Was not given a flight pack (socks, toothbrush and paste) this time. The inflight food was sufficient and tasty.",2
"The star of this film is the screenplay. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we don't hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo to-day. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great film....",2
"Both operating profit and net sales for the six-month period increased, respectively from EUR0.4 m and EUR3.2 m, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005.",2

"Phoned York branch of Richer Sounds and made initial inquiry, which was enthusiastically dealt with by Tom. 1 Hour later, having received a personalised confirmation email, I'm in the shop, the equipment is all set up and I'm well impressed.

"I'm not going to tell you the specifications of the High Roller since most reviews already have told you that the 550 foot observation wheel is currently the tallest in the world.\nI recommend riding at night versus the day since you really get to see a stunning view of the entire Las Vegas Valley. For the people that love airplanes, at night you can see the landing and take-off patterns into and out of McCarran.\n\nBefore going, check if Groupon or Amazon Local has a ticket deal.\n\nAlso if you have a Platinum, Diamond, or Seven Stars Total Rewards card, be sure to first stop at the Concierge Desk. Depending on your card level, you may be entitled to a larger discount or free tickets.\n\nA word of advice for locals: Present your Nevada ID and you get a $5 discount.",2

"After spending time with our son who just graduated Prescott College, we decided to have a two day get-away before flying home. We chose this hotel because of the good reviews on TripAdvisor. I must say, my husband and I really enjoyed the hotel. Make sure you don't take the cheapest suites, as they face the parking lot! We had a nice suite on the 3rd floor with a shady balcony looking into a courtyard. The cleaning staff were excellent and even vacuumed. Since it was off season (kids still in school), the hotel was quiet. The lazy pool and waterslide were great fun with no lines. The only thing I might add is that we ate at their 'Rico' restaurant, which wasn't exceptional at all. I highly recommend going out of the complex and finding better food.",2
"I ordered the litchi smoothie! Decadent, and deserving off a return visit.\nEveryone else in my group loved their drinks/deserts. No complaints!",2

"I will discuss Melbourne - LAX - LAX TO NRT (Tokyo) and back to Melbourne.
If possible try to avoid flying the old version of the a380, the seats are nowhere near as comfortable as the 777-300er. Service throughout all legs was amazing and consistent, this is why I love Singapore Airlines. The food was amazing and the book the cook option is a great way to have the option to select different meals. The beef burger was unbelievable , true quality.
Whilst the 777-300er requires you to stand up to change the seat to a bed, it's not a bad thing at all , gives you a chance to stretch. Very comfortable even with the cubby hole, it's not that bad though I did have the bulkhead for a couple of the legs.
The seat is super wide an extremely enjoyable.
I was fortunate enough to try the 787-10 from Narita to Singapore and I didn't enjoy it at all. When lying down I felt claustrophobic , it was like a coffin. The seat isn't anywhere near as wide though wide enough.",2
"Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness!!! I have a celebrity crush on Penn in the worst way, so when my friend Maggie told me she could get me complimentary tickets to see Penn and Teller when I was visiting Vegas I did a happy dance and then gushed like a teenager (it wasn't pretty). \n\nShe managed to get me tickets on a Saturday morning for a show that night (yes, I am aware that she's amazing and wonderful) and insisted that I thank Penn during their after show meet and greet, but we'll get back to that.\n\nBefore the show even starts there is a wonderful piano player to keep you entertained. I feel bad because I can't remember his name and one doesn't expect a tattoo-covered man to play jazz so you'd think I would have paid more attention. It's certainly worth it to get there early and give him a listen.\n\nThe show itself is fantastic. There are still several tricks and slight-of-hand moments that I'm in awe of (the ball and hoop one is still driving me crazy). My friend Kadima felt it was a bit too preachy, but I didn't mind it at all. Hell, I read the politics part of the newspaper first so I'm used to FAR more opinioned rhetoric. My friend Kimmy adores Teller so she was quite excited by the whole thing. \n\nIf you enjoy magic, mixed with social commentary, some slight-of-hand that is explained to you while someone is playing the stand-up base, well then this is the show for you. Definitely has a hefty helping of sarcasm and debunking of certain opinions of magic, which is also nice. \n\nAlso, both Penn and Teller hang out after the show for a meet and greet and they stick around for every single person which is so generous. The wait isn't that long and when it came my turn to thank Penn. let's just say I was thisclose to jumping up and down and freaking out. I was shaking with nerves and my friends had to push me forward to give me the nerve to thank him. Let me just say he was so genuine and kind and it's hard to be freaked out around someone so nice. \n\nOverall, I'd like to go back and see the show again as they added in some new elements the week after I was there. Also, there's nothing like a celebrity crush to keep a girl going. Sigh.",2
Went here last night and was so pleased we did as the food was awesome! Perhaps not 'authentic' Malay but VERY GOOD Malay some of the best we've had. Beef Rendang was our top pick and delicious! We also had chicken tumeric coconut curry (not sure what called) but the chicken was so tender and great tasting! Also great great service from our waitress. The menu was also extensive with western and Malay...want to come back!,2

"This is our 2nd time staying at the Novotel This time with our teenagers The hotels plus points are location...amazing views from the seating area outside .....no other hotel has this rooms very clean breakfast will suit everyone lots of choice very friendly.

Would definitely recommend one tiny negative comment would not put us off coming back again and again Loved it....Thankyou very much",2

This is very helpful for me. I used to travel with my husband before, and I have to sit back seat and watch the baby. Now I use the mirror to be very clear. I don’t have to sit in the back row.",2
"Positives
Great location (Soho)
Clean, slick room and bathroom, good facilities and nice bed
Helpful staff (concierge for bookings and desk)
Good general atmosphere (lots of buzz, plenty of visitors to the bar who weren't from the hotel)
Negatives
Room sizes are small (as described elsewhere)
Internal decor and style feels a bit dated (i.e. edgy 10 years ago)
Very pricey for the room size and general experience (but then, this is NY)
The whole thing was a bit too self-knowing cool - behaviour of some of the staff jarred
Summary
Hotel is in a great location but the price is high for little space (though what there is is quite nice). It's an interesting place to stay with a vibrant atmosphere.
The decor is very slightly worn in the obvious places, and looks a little outdated (standard redbrick building on the outside and Soho loft on the inside). Some of the staff were trying a bit too hard to be cool at the expense of allowing a slightly more laid back atmosphere, especially in the bar.
Would stay here again given the location, but would probably look elsewhere first. I feel for this price there may be better options.",2
"I've gone to Cherry Lash for a while now and I've never had a disappointing experience! The staff is amazing & the new Henderson location is convenient. At first I was unsure about extensions, but after one visit with Cherry Lash it became an addiction! \n\nI would recommend seeing Jasmine, a lash artist, because she is knowledgable & passionate. My appointments with her go by so quick & I'm constantly getting compliments on how flawless and natural my lashes look :)",2
"Very cool, chic decor...very south beach look and feel but without the crazy pricing and stuck-up vibe. Mediterranean menu with tons of great main course options, some excellent breads and cheeses to start and solid deserts. The wine menu was complete with a nice selection of both european and american reds. I ended up ordering a phenom watermelon salad and seared, ahi tuna for the main. Again, the menu has excellence all through it with a very reasonable price tag.\n\nMy only problem with the experience was the layout of the room we were sitting in. The seating around the edges of the room had a cool, rounded design to it but the tables were rectangles...which meant you could NOT sit in the center of the rounded bench seating without reaching 2 feet in front of you to get to your plate. The rest of the rooms in the restaurant looked to have squared seating and tables, so I think it was just the area we were in.",2

"I just went to Kaleidoscope Cafe for my anniversary dinner. We went on a Wednesday evening and we were the first ones in the restaurant, which was a bit unsettling. It didn't last long and I got over it quickly, however, and proceeded to have an outstanding evening.\n\nWe started out with the Kaleidoscope Salad and Apple Chicken Sausage Saute. The salad was very good, the chicken sausage dish was definitely our favorite. It was a great blend of sweet brie and fruit with savory sausage, I highly recommend it as the appetizer. We also received complementary warm pita bread and pineapple/rum/brown sugar butter, which was tasty.\n\nWe ordered the gnocchi and the salmon for our main courses, and both were excellent. The salmon was flavorful on a yummy risotto and the gnocchi was light and fluffy in a savory Indian sauce. We skipped dessert because we were pretty stuffed from all of the food and the bottle of wine we brought to share.\n\nSince Kaleidoscope is BYOB, our total bill was just over $60, which is a fantastic price for the quality and quantity of our respective meals. It is definitely worth the \""off the beaten path\"" location to get this much flavor per dollar without sacrificing portion size or service.\n\nThere is not much room and the interior decorations are not nearly as cool as the exterior, so make reservations and go with a bit of an open mind. But whatever you do, don't miss it!",2

"Have stayed here at least six times since 2004.you could not ask for a better location in new york city.walk out the hotel and your are in the middle of times square.the hotel itself is very big and very busy which is the way i like it as you are anonymous.rooms are large,clean and when you shut your door it is complete silence.have been lucky and had a view basic priced rooms with a stunning view of times square,but you can pay more to guarantee this.staff are friendly,helpful and efficient.all in all a great place to stay.not cheap but worth every penny.",2
"There is no better location thanThe Latham when it comes to being in the heart of Georgetown. We were very disappointed , however, when we arrived after a long drive, only to be told that we had no reservation. Moreover, the desk manager told me the two bedroom suite I reserved was no longer available. Because I keep meticulous notes, I produced a printed copy of my online reservation. The desk clerk challenged the copy, however, because in spite of the reservation number printed on the copy it did not reflect the date on which I reserved the room. He directed me to a desk top computer in the lobby to find better evidence of my claim. When I found my originial correspondence I asked that the clerk come from behind the desk in lieu of me sending a copy of my email to him within 10 feet. Silly. I was very disappointed with this reception. Suddenly, my room was available and we were given the key to our room. Sadly we had even called the night before to ask for an early check and I was told that would be ""no problem."" I received no apology from the manager or from the corporoate office even though I filled out an online survey from the hotel within a week after our departure.
The support staff (i.e. doorman, pool man) was very accommodating, but the management is sub-par.
The suite reflected past glory, but the carpet was old and worn.

"We only needed a room for 1 night and after staying in Hampton Inn for 3 straight days I was glad that it was only for 1 night.
The hotel is located about 15 minutes from downtown San Diego and the traffic traveled very quickly on the highway. The area that the hotel is in could be called a working class neighborhood and felt ok during the day but we stopped for gas at night and there were drunk people and homeless looking people walking around .
I had booked the room because I wanted to have a room large enough for 2 adults and 3 teenagers. The room has a large kitchen, foldout couch, tv , full bathroom and the adjoing room has 2 queen beds and a tv. After staying several nights in a Hampton Inn , which we paid $151 a night , and then staying here for $143 a night I think that they are charging too much.
The pillows are very small and flat but the beds were comfortable. The breakfast area is well staffed but the eating area is very small. Most people were getting something to eat and taking it to their room. The only hot foods were waffles and instant oatmeal. The door to the breakfast room was left open to the outside so I can see it would be easy for insects coming straight into the room. If that door is to remain open then I would suggest adding a screen door.
The hotel staff is extremely polite and helpful. Their great attitude does not make up for the questionable area of the hotel, small pillows, little breakfast area and what I think is too high of a rate for the room.",2

Close to Broadway. Very quiet hotel. Extremely clean.

"We booked our rooms through Southwest and got a great deal (even better than Expedia). We have a beautiful city view that the hotel emphasized with wall to wall windows! The bathroom could have used a bit of an update, but it must have just been my room (I was on 31). My friend who was on 14, had a crappy view, but a very modern bathroom. Also the bathroom drain didn't drain very well, but the hotel staff fixed it when I reported it. Unfortuantly my room was next to the stair well which lead me being woken up at 1am from a bunch of people that had too much to drink.",2
The food there is fresh and good!,2
I returned to Richer Sounds in Bath to make a second purchase. and once again Corban was extremely helpful and patient with answering my questions.,2
"Hey I just got this and so far I like it a lot
Hey I just got this and so far I like it a lot! I ordered a dif one last week but returned it because it seemed to bang around and was also flimsy. This one was easy to assemble, and there were no rough edges, mismatched holes or missing hardware. Instructions easy, but it's so simple you don't really need them. I took another reviewers advice and put the rungs from largest on top to smallest on bottom and like how that works, allows a bit more drying space. There is of course some minor movement of the rack because the bottom isn't fastened down, but following another reviewer's advice, put some leftover rug pad fabric under the top hooks to get a snug, quiet fit and to keep from scratching the paint. Also, as mentioned by yet another reviewer, I ordered some little stick on cushions, but didn't h ave them yet, i just used the tiny little square band-aids on all of the protruding screws on back and it worked great. I might just leave them since they don't show. (all the screws are in the back, at least 12 of them, and they all stick out from the frame and will scratch up the finish on your door with the movement of adding and removing towels.) So, now no scratching of the paint and also is quieter, no banging and all the connections are tight. If you put a bath size towel on this, you'll have to fold in it half, so not great if you want it for drying. But works great for washcloths and hand towels spread out to dry. Will update if any change, but this simple rack i think is better than the other choices. They really should include the stick on bumpers for the screws in back with the purchase, though.",2

"I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video. Sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots. The thing you seem to be missing is that it's still entertaining and really very fun. The effects range from, like someone on here has said, pasty-faced zombies that look like KISS rejects to really good ones with some amazing latex work. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the gore and this film is amazing in that area. The effects are very good for such a small film. Someone called it a Party movie and it is. 100% fun party movie. I have heard from various websites that this is actually a ""rough cut"" of the film that got general release but the actual ""director's cut"" is coming on DVD and it is very nice quality. I will buy it and judge for myself.Story is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. The gov't closes it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. Some of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. A few actors do a great job, there's some pretty straight social commentary that is insightful and true, good music, great lighting, some effective suspense and tons of blood and sick gore. One guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what I mean. Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth. Another is torn in half like in Day Of The Dead and they did a great job of that effect. There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action. I say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market. Two great undead epics.OK - UPDATE!!! I just got the DVD set and here is what I thought:MUCH better picture quality and for once I was able to see the actual DIRECTOR'S CUT of the film and it is a much better movie. I liked it before, but now I can see what Todd Sheets was actually trying to do with this one. And the commentary helps too, hearing Sheets talk about the film in detail, He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't this much fun!PS - I heard they are now remaking this on a big budget???",2

The Tony Gonzalez passed right by me and I almost fainted. hehe just kidding hubby. The rock shrimp is to die for, the sushi is perfect, even the little river stone they give you at the table to rest your chopsticks on is perfect. This is definitely not your average Japanese restaurant so if you're looking for an experience, this is the place to go.",2

I travel to NYC for business almost every week and have been staying at the loft off and on for the last 3 months. It has been a great alternative to staying in a hotel.

The location is ideal.,2

"We stayed here for the first 5 nights of our trip to NYC (for our wedding anniversary). The service at the Library Hotel is one of the best I've ever experienced. The staff is warm, friendly, efficient. We were greeted with a bottle of Prosseco in our room for our anniversary. We found the continental breakfast perfect size for us. The roof top deck was fabulous. We had it all to ourselves on several occasions. I was apprehensive when I walked into the room and bathroom and saw how small they both were, however, both are very efficiently designed. The tv is tiny, but we weren't in nyc to watch tv. We much preferred this cozy, intimate boutique hotel to the large, modern luxury hotel we moved to in lower manhattan for the last 2 days of our trip. We'd definitely stay here again. It is pricey, but we felt the service, perks (breakfast, wine & cheese, rooftop deck) were worth the price. Also, it's a very quiet hotel which we appreciated.",2
"I work in Tempe 15 times a year but always stay at Pointe Hilton because the concierge makes sure I have a great Casita which is like your own little home. He always insures that I have a quick check out and if i need anything printed or reservations he is there to assist. I always suggest my fellow employees from my company stay here as well and they also love the location. 10 minutes to airport, lots of restaurant options in area. The only negative is that the restaurants could use better management since it takes a long time to get served when it is not even crowded. They are always short of servers but I think it is because of the recession that they can't keep people employed...
For those considering this Hotel, introduce yourself to David and I am certain he will insure your stay is a positive one...Great Athletic center...A real club",2

"Having lived in France for over a decade, I can affirm that this place is pretty authentic. The soup was a Cream of Carrot that was quite tasty though a little too creamy for my taste. The entrec\u00f4tes were perfectly cooked, both the \""\u00e0 point\"" and the \""saignant\"", according to the French style. If you're looking for \""medium\"" or \""rare\"", you might want to ask for a little longer on the grill. The frites were just like in France, the salad was fresh, the dressing was authentic, and the wine list was great. The service was also friendly and attentive. And at that price, what more can one hope for? I'll be back.",2

I wanted a set up in my garage and this is perfect. It's well built, easy to assemble doesn't take up very much room.

The atmosphere is great, and the live music was very enjoyable. Food-wise, can't say too much about it except that the curry fries are delicious (don't knock it 'til you've tried it).\n\nOh, and no cover! That's pretty awesome! I'll definitely be back soon.",2

My daughter slept on the sofa bed and she said it was as comfortable as any regular bed. The amenities, such as the mini-fridge and coffee machine, in our room were just what we needed and I don't think we could have asked for anything more.
Also, we planned to do a lot of sightseeing so having a bus stop so close by was great, and there were many eateries and shops within only a short walk away. Would definitely stay here again!",2

"I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin'), or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.7/10",2

We discovered this when we checked our balance with the card company, were never notified the hotel intended to charge our card for this. After several phone calls and a meeting with the hotel comptroller, we thought it was taken care of, as the authorization was released. However, the following day, we were actually charged the entire bill. A little embarrassing for a small ($7) charge to be declined. The charge was reversed that night. ES did, once they realized we had already paid, offer us a dinner at a local restaurant and we supposedly are receiving a voucher for a one night stay in the mail.
The pool area was also disappointing, as it is not the hotel pool, but is shared with a local health club. The pool is closed periodically to guests, as water aerobics classes for the club members take place. We were also told that our children must ""be quiet"" or leave the pool...
they and the only other children there were playing ""Marco Polo"" - no other guest in the pool area, no one in the work out area, just one employee we were bothering as she chatted on her cell phone. We addressed this with hotel management and her attitude changed.
Housekeeping left much to be desired - more correctly described as tidying - no trash bags in the cans, room service trays were left in the hallways for long periods of time.
The breakfast and reception are ES standards, and this one was just like the others - the staff members there were especially helpful.
At nearly $200 per night, we were mostly disappointed with our stay.",2
"Now, this hotel is situtated right next to Yamashiro - (Mountain Castle) a sushi restuarant with a breathtaking view of Los Angeles. The property has been part of Hollywood History for almost 100 years. The property consists of lower hotel (Magic Castle , up the hill is Hollywood Hills Hotel then turn to the peak is Yamashiro - all walking distance)
The Hollywood Hlls Hotel is adjacent to The Magc Castle Club where check in, unlimited snacks and complimentary breakfast are available. The hotel is not modern or chic. It doesn't have any flat screen televisions or Ipod docks. However it's pool is next to Yamashiro garden and has a great view of Hollywood since the whole property is situated up in the hills.
It's walking distance to Hollywood Boulevard and Highland. SO the location is a Gem. I had a good experience with my stay. We tried the 1 bedroom suite and the kitchen and restroom were clean stocked with towels and all. It was also quiet and a nice walk down the hill to Hollywood Blvd. (A free shuttle is also available to and from Magic Castle entrance) Parking is $11 a night.
I'll definitely come back- however if you're looking for a luxurious hotel with automatic draperies this isn't it... The Hollywood Hills Hotel is more rustic, simple and tranquil.",2

"My best friend's pre-and-post wedding party were in the lounge/club here and the reception was in the restaurant, it is one of the best kept secrets in Mandalay Bay! \n\nOur waitress never kept us without a drink in our hand, she took pictures for us and even watched our bags while we danced. The atmosphere is amazing, not just because of the view but the design, the people who are there and the staff. \n\nFor the wedding we had one of the best three course meals I've ever had, we shared a selection of wine and mixed drinks that were always available when desired. Soft music, candle-light and a perfect view of the strip made this one of the most memorable nights I've had in Vegas. And the wedding cake/desert coffee were so good they had all the guests asking how to make them or where the ingredients came from.\n\nThe bathroom was super clean, with an even better view than the restaurant. The dance floor was perfect, good music and energetic customers. The bouncer even made sure the elevator rides at the end of the night weren't a huge dash to fit 100 people in 1 elevator. \n\nThere is nothing bad to say about THEmix, this should be the start to every good night in Las Vegas.",2
"I had been having an awful lot of issues trying to order an EE mobile broadband device through Carphone warehouse and after phoning through many times, and none of the customer service assistants being very helpful, I eventually got through to a MARK BURNS who’s customer service was absolutely exceptional! I could not fault it, he was very patient and understanding and, unlike everyone else I had tried previously, did not pass me off or tell me the problem couldn’t be solved, he stayed on the phone and even waited 1/2 an hour for me to phone through to EE to change some details so my mobile broadband device could be sent out. This is the perfect example of amazing customer service, thank you so much for getting this sorted for us!

"Foolishly, I left my keys in my checked bag. Shouldn't have been a problem, except I arrived on the last flight into Austin that night, and my bag didn't. What could I do? I went to the hotel phone kiosk, and decided to call the Super 8. I've had a negative impression of Super 8, but at the late hour, they were affordable, and still offered a shuttle. I'm so glad I called this hotel. A very nice, modern, well kept property, everyone working there was so friendly and welcoming. The large, clean rooms even included a free bottle of water and some snacks. Their continental breakfast included eggs, sausage biscuits, and bacon. I woke up later than I planned, so I asked if I could delay my shuttle back to the airport for breakfast, and they accommodated me with a smile. I couldn't have been happier with my stay.",2

"I recently stayed at the New Yorker hotel with a friend on a 5 day trip to New York.
We arrived to find the reception busy, as it was at most times of the day, but the staff were quick and efficient in seeing to us and we were checked in swiftly.
We were allocated a room on the 20th floor and unfortunately, you won't get much of a view at this height, but if you come to New York to sit in a hotel room, you are in the wrong city.
The room was a double double, sorted out for us by Kelvin, with two large double beds and two bathrooms, which was a bonus. It was very nicely laid out and very clean and I'm glad to say it wasn't decked out in an ultra modern style, it's an old hotel with a history, so it would not have been right for an ultra modern interior.
I have seen some reviews commenting on the bathroom needing to be updated, but I found the bathrooms to be just right, with some original features still intact from when the hotel was built. I would be appalled if these were replaced.
The hot water in the shower was a tad changeable, in that it could go cold for a second or two then return to normal. I just put this down to be it being an old building, certainly not worth complaining about.
My only complaint about the room is that there is no safe, I have an expensive camera and although the hotel do provide safety deposit boxes at the reception area, my camera was too large for it and would have liked to manage my money and passport etc from my room. However, the safety deposit boxes are very secure and have to be opened by both you and a hotel employee using two keys.
Attached to the hotel you have two eating establishments, the Tick Tock Diner and Coopers Tavern. I will review them separately.
Tick Tock diner - A very busy, classic American Diner, I visited twice at different times and both times it was packed, but I was seated quickly and the service was very quick. The portions are massive, so bring your appetite and I would recommend the omlettes.
Coopers Tavern - This kind of became my local in New York, pefect for popping in for a quick pint after a hard day sightseeing or shopping. I could not fault the staff of Coopers, especially Marina who was brilliant behind the bar, remembered me after one visit and was always helpful and pleasant.
It's not the cheapest place in NYC, but it's certainly not the most expensive. I ate here once and got a burger stack, it was huge, and very nice.
On leaving the hotel, we were checked out with little fuss and the staff were as efficient as when we arrived and wished us a safe trip.
We required a car for the airport and the transportation desk sorted one out for us with little fuss, I didn't get the tall guy who dealt with us name, but he was very good. Our car was there when we needed it and it saved us having to bother about cabs, tolls, tips etc as it was all included in the $75 fee.
We left our bags in the hotel and nipped to Coopers for a beer before getting the Lincoln Towncar to JFK.
All in all, we had a brilliant stay at the New Yorker, there was a review which stated the area might not be safe around the hotel, but we found this to be not right as we were out and about at all hours and never once felt uneasy.
I will be returning to NYC next March and I will definitely book with the New Yorker again, you simply cannot get a better location.
A massive thumbs up.",2
"I'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie.I adore this movie, and so does everyone I work with -- and that is the point. I spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. Such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. Most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama! Possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out-of-script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance.Since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on TV. But hardly anyone has done it so well.",2
"Three of us booked a room at the Sheraton for a Conference held there. We were given exceptional service for numerous complications over conference rate vs. regular rate, getting an extra room in an extremely pack hotel (two conferences at the hotel plus the Philly Marathon) and last minute speaker needs. We had excellent service for both the conference needs and personal needs from the housekeeping staff (Blessing), concierge (Mary), Front Desk (Phillip, Crystal, Toni), Lobby Bar (Nicole) plus extra special attention from Edward in security! First rate hotel and service. Excellent. Thank you.",2
"I've read over some of the reviews, and I feel like this place is getting a beating by my fellow yelpers.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a Mediterranean food connoisseur, but I know good food.\n\nThis place has good food. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I stumbled in there for dinner on Christmas day. We had celebrated with family on Christmas Eve and all day Christmas and we wanted to \""get away\"" for some \""us\"" time. We walked in and were seated right away. They were slow because EVERYTHING in Summerlin was closed that day and people probably figured they were too. I was surprised that they had a HUGE FULL bar, a karaoke stage, dance floor, huge projection tv, and the blue lighting made the place seem fun and festive. I could definitely see a birthday party there.\n\nAnyways, we ordered the hummus and pita, lamb shank plate, and lamb gyro. EVERYTHING was good. the hummus, the pita (which we got more of at no charge), the lamb, the GYRO was amazing, and the rice. Dang that rice was good!\n\nI am giving them 5 stars because the food was AWESOME. Yes, the service could probably be better (waitress had to be reminded of things, but was SUPER nice), but we're talking $11-$17 meals. It's not an arm and a leg ...and you're getting generous portions in a fun environment with relatively nice service. So, I would gladly, GLADLY have the \""okay\"" service and awesome food for that price.\n\nAfter all, it's all about the food isn't it? :)",2
By far the best food ever! So glad we found this place. Very unique menu. Excellent service! Thanks Marco! We will definitely be returning. They will be seeing much more of us.,2

"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in March. It was my first time in New York and the location was brilliant for exploring all the sights. Approximately 5 mins from Times Square on foot and ideal if you wanted to catch the metro at Port Authority. When the receptionist learnt that it was my first time in New York, he allocated us a room with a view of the Empire State building. We only ate breakfast once in the hotel, it was difficult to find a table, but the food was adequate and there was plenty of choice. The staff were always helpful and polite. The bar is a nice place to relax after an evening out and was never very busy whilst we were there. The room was big compared to some city hotels, and the kitchenette facilities were good and would suit a family wanting to do some cooking in the hotel. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to New York. Good value for money and well located.",2
"We live in far Northwest San Antonio and often do not take advantage of the Downtown area as we won't drink and drive. So, not able to get away for my wife's birthday due to hosting for Thanksgiving, we decided to have a small staycation in our home town.
We were enticed into booking the Mokara on a third night free promotion and we were a little nervous that we might get an ""off"" room due to the discount. We were pleasantly pleased with the huge room with gorgeous river view and gigantic bath with large Jacuzzi/ garden tub.
Very late nights made for lazy mornings and room service was prompt with the Bloody Mary's (very tasty!) and breakfast.
The staff was quite helpful and we received an email from the concierge prior to arrival welcoming us and asking if we had needs and/ or were we in for an occasion. They had great suggestions for our Birthday weekend.
An excellent hotel which we would recommend highly!",2

"i don't know why a group of 20 somethings would ever stay anywhere else! If youre the average 24 year old like myself THIS is the place to be. \n\nIf youre like me, you probably travel in a big group (over 6).\n\nIf youre like me, you have money, but not vasts amounts that can be thrown around for a weekend trip to vegas that you do 4 times a year with your friends. \n\nIf youre like me, you tell yourself \""oh the room doesn't matter, we're barley in it anyway.\"" But then get annoyed at sharing the two queen beds, luggage everywhere. And one small bathroom.\n\nPh towers solves all these problems.\n\nLast time we went, we had the one bedroom king suite. You get a full kitchen (with utensils and plates and everything), a dining table, a living room, a bedroom, and a huge bathroom.\n\n There were 6 of us, and we all fit comfortably. 3 on the king bed, 2 on the pull out from the couch. And one on the part of the couch that wasn't a pull out.\n\nWe all had room for our luggage.\n\nAnd the bathroom was set up so someone could be taking a shower, another taking a shit, another brushing their teeth, and another straightening their hair, without being in each others way.\n\nThe size of the room makes pre partying even better/more comfortable.\n\nWe saved a bunch of money by going to the grocery store and getting things like bagels, and sandwich stuff so we wouldn't keep spending money on food, and focus on more important things like booze.\n\nAnd its right in the middle of the strip (unlike palms place which is the same set up (slightly bigger), and more expensive).\n\nAnd its just amazingly cheap for what you get!\n\nPlus it helps that it looks really nice, its brand new, you have a legit Jacuzzi, a bunch of tvs that you'll never use, a projector and all that good ish.\n\nThe only down side (if you call it one) is that there is no casino and not very busy, but you can go to planet Hollywood and get that if you want.\n\nIf I had a considerable amount of money, and was traveling with a smaller group, id probably prefer to go to the \""nicer\"" hotels. But for now, this is as good as it gets. You pay barely anything (it was 250 a night (over the weekend!) when we went), you feel like a baller (since youre in a large suite), and it's the best deal you can get.",2
"Ok, let me start by saying I am a huge fan of this place. Great restaurants, and friendly and helpful staff. One thing that strikes you as you walk thru casino is the odd mix of patrons. On the one hand you have the locals from the grey hair set who are walking laps from the slot machines and the buffet. on the other hand you have the younger and considerably more scantily clad hip crowd. That being said the two groups do not seem to get each others way. This place is a great experiment in tolerance and coexistence. So I say make the short trip off the strip and check out The Palms. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2

I stayed here while traveling for business. It was a very impressive room with a great view. The public areas are amazing and truely make you feel like you are in a palace.

"I got a GREAT rate for this hotel from a discount website and I was a little hesitant but for the money it couldn't be beat. We checked in and the lobby was very pleasant. We told the front desk lady that it was our first time away with no kids since we got married 13 years ago and we met in NYC so it was amazing to be back (all true). She got us an upgraded room and gave us some free drink vouchers!
Got to our room and we had a view of the Empire State building which was awesome, but the best thing was the room -it was HUGE! Very impressive. Bed was comfy and everything was perfect. Bathroom was a little shabby but perfectly clean and the bathrobes were a nice touch.
Location was awesome! We took the shuttle from LaGuardia and it stops at Grand Central Station which was only 2 blocks from the hotel. We couldn't hear any noise from our room and we slept like babies!!!
If I come back to NYC - I will definitely check to see if theres room at the St. Giles!",2
Easy acces to this hotel. Average room. Very helpfull frontdesk personnel. The BW is located opposite of some restaurants. There is a great Chinese buffet restaurant. Very very good.

"Only in a Hawaiian restaurant is it endearing (and not tacky) when your server comes around, holding her baby while taking your food order ;)\n\nSeriously though, Island Flavor is legit! True Hawaiian food at its best!!! I found this restaurant through Yelp and it is worth the (less than) 20 minute drive from the strip. \n\nMy boyfriend & I split the Furikake Poke, while he opted for the Fried Rice Omelet with Portuguese Sausage and I got the combo with KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and Teri Beef.....Omgaaaah, so delicious (or should I say \""ono\""!) The portions were monstrous, but most importantly, the food was amazing. I have been craving REAL Ahi Poke and I'm so glad I got to have my fix here! Huge chunks of fresh Ahi Poke sprinkled with Furikake mmm, it was perfect. I have also been on a Korean Fried Chicken kick recently, and Island Flavor definitely got it right. So crispy, juicy and garlicy! The Teri Beef was great quality (not thin or stringy at all) and the sweet sauce was the clincher. No lie, everything we ate was amazing....even the Mac salad and Guava Juice!\n\nI am definitely going to try to come here next time I'm in Vegas :) Now seriously, can we get a Hawaiian joint as good as this in So Cal?

This is not a blood and gore scary type movie, but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. Of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie. Truth is, this movie is a must have for your thriller collection, even if it does have a religious view. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and its a must have. I never saw the sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe it picks up where this movie ends.",2

"My wife and I recently spent a long weekend at the Ames. We received a warm welcome on arrival and check in was smooth and quick, even though we arrived a few hours before official check in time our room was ready. The room, a junior suite, was very modern, clean and spacious. The bathroom was one of the biggest I have ever seen at a city hotel and was bigger than the total size of some rooms I have stayed in. There was a separate seating/lounge area with sofa's, table and chairs, desk and TV. The room was at the front of the hotel and we did get quite a lot of noise from the street, but it's right in the city and some noise can be expected. Anyway, it didn't keep us awake, but I sleep heavy so if you are a light sleeper I would suggest you request a room at the side/back.
Complementary breakfast was a selection of bread and fruit with coffee. The atmosphere in the breakfast room was very laid back and casual, which was great, but be aware the menu is very limited and if you want something more substantial you will need to go and find it somewhere else.
On the whole a great stay, we enjoyed this place.",2
"My husband and I stayed at this property during a quick 3 day trip to NYC. Check in was quick and easy, the staff member (Christine I think) checking us in was very friendly and efficient. The hotel itself is very pretty with the lobby area hosting a great bar with a VERY nice bartender. The drinks were great, and the ambiance perfect.
We also found the rooms here to be a great size for being in the city, it was a much larger and much better appointed room than rooms we have had in other local hotels.
If you are at all interested in shows the concierge (Adam) was incredibly helpful, he spent about 20 minutes with us giving us honest opinions on his favorite shows, calling ticket brokers, making reservations, etc. We received excellent seats to a great show and were very happy with all the work he put into our evening. He also had excellent recommendations for dinner reservations and called to make them for us. Amazing service thanks Adam!!
Overall, great property, great stay and we would definitely stay here again!",2

And everything you need is on the touch screen phone room service, if you want to turn off the lights its so cool. The pool is heated which is great. And the food wow! so good the pancakes & orange juice were my favorite so fresh & organic.

"This hotel was pretty nice for the most part. The staff was great and always helpful when ever you have a question. I stayed in a 2 room lakeview suite on the 17th floor(top floor). My suite had 2 double beds and a queen size pull out couch, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, and 2 sinks. The suite was very nice with the exception of the fan in the restroom which did not work. After looking up at the ceiling to see the air vent I could clearly see why the fan did not work. There was at least 1 inch of dirt and grime covering every portion of the vent. Nothing went in or came out so it wasnt any bother to me. Other then that the room was great and the beds were comfortable. The lakeview we had was very nice. We were fortunate enough to be there on a Wednesday night when at the Navy Pier they shoot off fireworks. We sat in the luxury of our room at had a 100% un-obstructed view of the fireworks.
The two things I would have to say sets this hotel apart from others is the package I had came with valet parking and hot to order breakfast each morning for everyone in your party. The parking alone would have cost at least $40 per day. The hot to order breakfast each day was great. They will make eggs, omlets, biscuits and gravy, sausage, bacon, pancakes, potatoes, etc......
There is a store named Dominicks right across from the hotel for any of your needs incase you forget something, need beer, etc... You can also buy passes there for the trains and buses.
Navy Pier is about a 4 block walk from the hotel and is great for an early morning walk or jog along the lake.
Overall I would recomend this hotel to others. It is in a great location to everything and the rooms are decent. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!",2

I make a call to this shop inquiring a particular bouquet I was interested in after seeing it on their website. The young lady who answered was very welcoming and they helped me each step of the way as I decided what flowers I wanted to go with. I would strongly recommend this shop for their friendly and quality service. \n\nI spoke to Paula. She'll take very good care of you.,2
i feel is so vital to help get those questions answered by someone who really knows the program your in,2
i feel pretty honoured that she entrusted me with the duty of documenting her dear family on her anniversary weekend,2
"The name of this property changed in 2012 from an InterContinental Hotel to the Royal Sonesta. No fears, this hotel remains a gem! Excellent location and wonderful staff! Large, clean, well-lit and functional rooms with comfortable beds! Above average fitness room, featuring more than just a few cardio machines. (The vending machine in the fitness room, I'll admit, made me laugh as it included M&Ms, Doritos, Coca-Cola and more not-so-healthy choices, among other offerings.) Try the on-site restaurant; despite its lame name, The Restaurant, dinner was very good, and not too over-priced for an on-property restaurant. Must admit, some of the best hotel staff I have ever encountered at one property. Have to give credit to Reese (front desk), Sergio (car valet), and Yashar (concierge lounge) - each was friendly and professional, well deserving of a pat-on-the-back for jobs well done. Encountered air conditioner and TV issues upon check-in; each was immediately fixed! Definitely will be back!!",2
Not so happy with Face book but there are peaples sending things that i dont agree,2
"Yes the room was nice...and yes the location was perfectly convenient. But what gives this place 5 stars and knocks it out of the park are the people that work there. Two in particular i'd like to point out because by the end of our stay, they felt like friends. Jo jo the bartender at the restaurant was not only attentive and great at his job...but went so above and beyond to make our visit (we went twice) to the restaurant one to remember. They make fabulous bellinis...go hit him up for some of those! And finally, Serge the manager. I don't think i've ever met a manager that attentive and dedicated to making sure that his guests were happy.
Overall, during out 3 night stay, on several occasions, random folks working at the hotel would ask how we were and if they could get us anything. AWESOME!
check out the little shop in the hotel...i found an awesome pair of earrings at literally jaw dropping price! never woulda thought i could find that at a little hotel gift shop! hahaa.
The Spa was great. I got a pedi and i wish i remember the name of my aesthetician...it was very relaxing. The Spa only gets a 4 though bc it was quite small...but service was great.
If you're staying on the Riverwalk...this is the place!",2
Great app with great songs and fantastic audio. 👏,2
"Simply the best! His \""hungarian fire bread\"" is seriously addictive. Generous portions - authentic flavor and aesthetics - and goid story telling!",2
Everything is good keep improving more features and you should also improve its voice like whenever chat gpt speaks urdu its accent isn't good so in my opinion developer should improve the language accent,2
"Food is better than average, prices are very very reasonable. On average 3-5 ringgit. Service was prompt on a pretty crowded Sunday morning.
Will visit again 😋",2
Useful. It depends how you used the tool,2
"Great place to pick up breakfast/lunch/snack! Super convenient if you are staying at the Bellagio in the Spa Tower. Ate a delicious ham & cheese panini (the mustard was awesome!) for lunch. Also had half a nutella crepe and a bite of a chocolate strawberry crepe, both were delicious! Throughout our stay I also tried a smattering of pastries for breakfast throughout the week (apple brioche, blueberry brioche, apple muffin, raisin cinnamon roll), all were excellent. I also bought the peanut brittle as a gift and they gave a nice bag to put it in. Avoid going at peak times, as the line can wrap around the counter.",2
"Melisa T, helped me to clarify all my doubts and she guided me in very detailed manner.",2
"Stayed her for four nights in early October 2008. Like many was a little concerned by reviews citing small rooms etc.
The Not So Good... Room IS small by US standards but good for NYC. Bathroom also small (but this allowed my wife to stay in bed longer while I got dressed!)
Window mounted aircon unit a little unpredictable and view uninspiring (onto an internal courtyard). Location is a little scary at night.
But...
The Good... Hotel staff very friendly and helpful (as was all the New Yorkers we met). Big bed (by our standards) Flat screen TV. Good cross-section of guests - airline staff, business people etc. The scaryness of the location is more in your head than in reality - provided you take the normal sensible precautions that most people do. Location is great - short walk to Times Square etc and spoilt for choice with eateries on 9th Avenue.
Take the opportunity to talk to the locals and see how really friendly they are - after all you are not going to stay in your room all day are you?!
Hotel rooms in NYC ARE expensive (we had a higher class room at Dupont Circle in DC later in our trip for less than we payed in NYC) but the WJ provides a good, clean safe base for a short trip.
I wasn't looking forward to staying in New York and saw it as a necessary evil before moving on to Washington DC. But my wife and I are already making plans to return in two years time and will probably stay again at the WJ or similar - the Waldorf Astoria being a little out of our league!
PS:The lift/elevator - everything you've read is true! We walked down at all times!",2
"You can be in the heart of downtown Chicago, with a suite and continental breakfast for a little over a hundred dollars. I was completely satisfied.",2
The food is still so similar to my early visits here around 2007 when they were still in Mid Valley. Great vegetarian food. Only difficult thing is to get parking. Probably best to use some form of ride sharing to get here.,2
Price is a little more than I care to pay but good service. No complaints,2
i feel strongly about surround yourself with people that are smarter and more talented than you and learn from them,2
i feel like my online identity is too sincere,2
"This review might have some of the same information as the one from Thornhill, below, becasue that one was written by my son after the first night. Now that we've completed our 4 night stay, here's the full scoop.
This hotel is ideally located on a quiet side street within easy walking distance of Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue stores and Rockefeller Center.
It is a converted apartment building but that doesn't matter - the rooms are standard, comfortable, nice sized hotel rooms (except the bathrooms - which are ridiculously small). The staff from front desk to door man are exceptional. They just can't do enough and they do it all quickly with a smile on their faces.
Here's what you need to know before booking the Belvedere:
1. Top floors have been recently renovated with new beds (very, very soft) and luxury linens, larger and newer TV's. But, because you are on a higher floor, your windows are in the open air meaning you hear every bit of traffic - horns, sirens, etc, that come from the major NYC streets below. And these go on continuously, all day and night. The lower floors facing the back (we were on the 6th after we moved from the 14th) have no view at all and back onto another apartment building. This insulation means we didn't hear any street noise at all from this room. A QUIET ROOM WOULD BE A LOWER FLOOR, CENTER OF THE BUILDING, FACING THE BACK.
2. The washroom is tiny. Don't plan on displaying any toiletries.
3. Blow dryer - awful. Call the front desk and the they will bring up a very powerful handheld blow dryer.
4. Elevators can be slow - there are service elevators on either side of the hallway. Use them.
5. There's a fridge and microwave in each room which are great for snacks and drinks. The little store on the corner has very reasonable prices on fresh fruit, drinks, etc.
6. The Conceirge is fabulous. She has great ideas and a lot of up to date information on restaurants, attractions etc. In fact, she told us to avoid an area restaurant because they had just changed chefs the week before and there were still a lot of kinks in the food and service. Her recommendations were great.
All in all, this hotel is very clean, comfortable (in the right room) and a great value for the location. It's not luxury by any means but it's a nice place to come back to after being out all day.",2
"We were in Seattle for a leisurely weekend. The location of this hotel was terrific. It was within walking distance of Pikes Market and a fairly level walk as well. It was within walking distance of the monorail which was very convenient for our visit to the Space needle and surrounding areas. There were a lot of wonderful restaurants to choose from. The hotel was very busy hosting a convention while we were there so other than it being difficult to get an elevator at times, it was actually quite quiet and didn't seem claustraphobic at all. The service level was still maintained. The room we were in was very clean, comfortable and we had a spectacular view of the city. The staff were attentive and pleasant. We have stayed here once before on the club level and really enjoyed it. We will be back.",2
"I am sure regular rooms are not so large, but I stayed in a double with 2 bathrooms!! That allowed my adult daughter and my husband and I to stay together and no waiting for the bathroom. Beware that they have double beds..........very cozy indeed when used to a king. The room was quite large, had a desk and sitting chair, small view of the lake. I ignored the ceiling paint peeling in the bathroom cause it is an old hotel.
Very close to shopping. There is an El stop outside one of the doors. To get to the airport (if you don't need help with the luggage), 2 blocks down the street is the BLUE line which goes to O'hare airport, way cheaper than a cab, and weekdays a safer bet getting to your flight on time. It takes about 30 minutes.
Drawbacks, seems a charge for everything now. Want a fridge/ $$ Gym? $$. On the internet do not try to change your reservation; like the airlines they will revert back to the current rate and you essentially rebook. I had to leave a day early and it was no problem at the front desk keeping my good rate. Front desk staff and concierge helpful as were the doormen.
The lobby is very busy afternoons and nighttime, worth sitting for a refreshment and watching the world go by. The refurbishment of the lobby back to its former glory is fantastic.",2
21 Bistro found near the start of Chinatown has array of local Chinese & Western food.I generally love their array of local & seafood! There was a local band singing Oldies but goodies of the past...ambience was just great as we were carried with the flow of music...and happy feet tapping away.Basically the Boss of the place is here every night to mingle with the crowd and it seems very homey where almost everyone knows one another.If you are in Kuching do drop by...it's a happy place for a drink or bite.,2
"We stayed at the Tuscan Inn for 2 nites in June 2004 and found it quite appealing. A superb location, reasonable price, easy access to all the main sights and transit lines to get around the city. Clean and well-appointed rooms were a bit smallish for a family of four, (we used a King, sofa bed and rollaway), but as one previous reviewer indicated, we spent most of our time out and about. Excellent staff and service and the adjoining Italian restaurant was superb. A very nice lobby. A very cheerful staff and prompt service. Highly recommended!",2
"Happy birthday to my lovely wife, we ordered Mexico Chicken, Honey Oat Chicken & Chicken Tikka. All taste delicious 😋Overall: I visit frequently, nice and cozy restaurant.",2
"This Residence Inn was located right off of the highway near restaurants and even a movie theatre. It isn't one of the newer hotels, but for the price, it was well worth it. I had a problem with my room, but after I spoke to the front desk employee....I think her name was Bailey?, the problem was immediately resolved and she went over beyond to make sure my stay was a positive one. This hotel is very lucky to have employees like this.
I will stay here again when business brings me back to Ft. Worth!",2
"respectful, careful",2
"Chose this hotel because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor For a recent 3 night trip to Philadelphia and was not disappointed. The property is in a great location within walking distance to all of the historical sites, Old Town and the great shops and restaurants along South Street. The hotel restaurant and lounge were excellent with fantastic service, would highly recommend the pulled pork or the Cheesesteak sandwiches as both were excellent. Our rate included daily breakfast which included a full buffet or menu al a carte items, both of which were great. Will definitely stay at this location when in Philadelphia again.",2
"Thank God for the Detroit Coney Grill! David, the owner, is super friendly and is on top of his business. My wife & I ordered 3 Coney dogs with mustard, fresh cut onions, and topped with a sweet chili, that was a nice bean less meat sauce. The hot dogs were hot, expertly grilled, not steamed! The buns were warm, fresh and steamed. The Detroit dogs were excellent! When you bite into them, they have a nice snap. Everything was just like what we grew up eating back east in CT & MA. \n\nWe also had a bag of Detroit Better Made potato chips and 2 bottles of Faygo root beer pop. We drove down from North Scottsdale and the trip was well worth it. We do hope David can open a spot up north, closer to our home. We give it an A+. We will come back again! Best of luck to David, the owner. Keep up the good work!",2
"Food is fab but service was very slow, maybe coz it was a huge crowd being served by a small team.",2
Its so good and cool...But I want to listen to it for free without using the internet.,2
"Our group had a block of rooms booked for the YCOA National Cheerleading competition. I was concerned after reading some of the previous reviews. For the price we paid, I was not expecting the Ritz. We had one of the former smoking rooms and there was a strong smell of disinfectant. No elevator. No fancy flat screen TV's. The internet worked great. The rooms were dated and they need to invest in some new bedspreads but it was clean and comfortable. The pool and hot tub were nice and well used with 8-14 year old cheerleaders. The girls loved it. They all had a great time.
My only complaints were that they only supplied one bath towel in the room for two people. Also, there is a mexican restaurant across the road that played loud music until 3AM on Saturday. This is ok if you want party but not if you are trying to sleep. So if you are considering stay here on a Saturday night, ask for on the north side of the building.",2
"Hotel piccolo in ottima posizione, personale molto disponibile, camera piccola ma molto pulita, colazione abbondante e varia, il ristorante dell'hotel e piccolo ma molto carino e il cibo è ottimo. Bar con happy hour dalle 5 alle 8 ideale per aperitivo relax prima di andare a cena.Ristoranti fantastici a un isolato sulla park avenue il primehouse e il huston's in particolare. Lo consiglio",2
"Overall, I was pleased with my stay at the Westin. My wife and I have stayed at several hotels in Boston and have always liked the Weston. While its not the Boston Harbor Inn, it is very nice and priced reasonably given its location. Only complaint was that I had asked for an early check in and while not guaranteed, they have always accomidated me in the past. Normal check in was 3:00 pm and we arrived at 12:30. Because the Red Sox had played a playoff game the night before they were sold out and behind. They took my cell number and said they would call when it was ready (1 to 1 1/2 hours they told us). We came back a little before 3:00 and it still wasn't ready. Without even asking the desk clerk had the floor manager come out and found us another room that was on the 24th floor (we originally had one on the 32nd) and appoligized for the trouble.",2
"The environment is good, but the food is a bit greasy.",2
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! The lunch specials are awesome- pizza or sandwich of your choice with any salad of your choice for under $10! I highly recommend trying the caprese bowl for your appetizer, it is RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS! It's a deconstructed bowl full of home-made burrata mozzarella, pesto, cherry tomatoes, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, served with a crisp artisan bread (so good I dream about this menu item!) The pizzas are served on a delicious, crisp, brick oven style sourdough crust... I have tried the SOP (it was ok) the Roasted Mushroom (Yum!) and the Fig and Prosciutto (AMAZING!) The salads are also delicious!",2
Good. Good for all but. Hypothetically sorely fantabulous in all areas. This app isn't good enough. It has some sorely problems to deal with but still ok for the best. And l hypothetically thank the maker in a quintillion times.👍,2
"Such a wonderful night out - food was so good! Staff were friendly and helpful, made the whole experience even better. It was my mum's birthday - so glad we decided to come celebrate here! Will definitely be back! :D",2
Food delicious. Good service. A good place for family dining.,2
"Outstanding hotel with a great location in a great city. Very clean and comfortable. Nice sized room and bathroom. Right off Michigan Ave and an easy walk to Lake Shore Dr to Navy Pier. Staff makes it a point to address you by name. They even sent champagne and strawberries up to the room for our anniversary. My wife loved the shopping situation right inside the building. Very convenient. Gloria, in the general manager's office, was especially kind and helpful. We would definitely stay there again.",2
"Perfect!
These are just as advertised. Love them. Great quality.",2
"As a New Yorker, I have really high pizza standards. And this place is fantastic!",2
Great service.quick in and out. Employees are always helpful and answer any questions.terrific beds and products.,2
"Five Stars
grandson is collecting his favorite movies. He was very happy with this gift",2
"Everything about this hotel was perfect, the check in experience, the room, the restaurant, the location, the professional and courteous service of the staff... I received the AAA rate @$125/night which included full buffet breakfast - not your typical buffet, but 5 stations with hot selections, cooked to order, and for those of us who don't eat pork, there were turkey and chicken selections... The room decor is contemporary and modern, clean, clean, clean... And the service is just exceptional. I can't rave enough about this hotel.",2
"I stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a well earned girls wk end. We were celebrating several special occasions. ALL the staff from check in to check out where at the top of their game. Every one went out of their way with each contact with us to make sure our stay was wonderful. I had the opportunity to recommend a hotel this wk and did not hesitate to suggest the Omni.
The Omni was located walking distance from most of our destinations. The ones that needed a cab ride where made easy by the door men, who gave the drivers directions for us.
My one tip would be to request a room in the front of the hotel, awesome city views. The side room windows face the side of another building.",2

"EVERY time I visit Las Vegas, this is my first stop. There are few food items in this world I would choose to eat over the Chicken Shack chicken sandwich.",2
"I love their chicken rice balls, roasted chicken and asam pedas. Their staff always provide fast service. I always come during dinner time and never had a problem getting a table.",2
Fast and reliable service. Quick delivery.,2
"Good sound quality and layout isn't too bad either ,worth getting , also you can play console games with the music in the background.",2
I m really enjoying,2
i feel is important to bring to light i wanted to explore what it means to be a mom and a daughter,2
"We came for hearing great music when we passed by the place then it turned out a right decision. Great music, friendly owner and staff. We spent our 3 nights there. Will definitely caome back if we visit Mallaca again.",2
"All Cabin Crews were unbelievably welcoming, polite, helpful and attentive. The service onboard was second to none. Nothing too kuch trouble for them.
Inflight meals from London to Singapore were lovely but from Singapore to Bangkok was disappointed. It was more like meal on a budget airline.
Toiletry kits were provided in lavatories even on a short haul flight from Singapore to Bangkok which was a nice touch. Lavatories were kept tidy & clean and snacks/drinks were well prepared in galleys between 2 meals tho.
A Ground Staff working at the Luggage Claim at Bangkok Airport on Tuesday 16th January was efficient. He looked after all luggage coming out very well (around 14.30-15.00).",2
"Great product
Works great! Love that this is way more efficient than running window units and a heck of a lot quieter",2
"My husband and I live here in San Antonio and were seeking an inexpensive way to spend our Valentine's Weekend. Check-in was very quick and easy with no hassles whatsoever. Our AAA rate was honored and an additional $18.50 was assessed for the hotel's valet parking service. Since the hotel is located in a very convenient location, we parked our vehicle and did not need it again until we checked out. We were assigned room 225 which has a queen sized bed. The room, although small, was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was absolutely spotless. The shower's water pressure was more than adequate although the water temperature did fluctuate back and forth from hot to cold to lukewarm. Amenities included in the room were the usual hairdryer, an iron/ironing board and in-room coffee maker (single use filter packets). The television was an older tv. Being that the pay-per-view movies were $15.99 each, we had hoped the tv would have been an updated, better quality, flat screen tv. Needless to say, we saved the money and took a walk instead. The Crockett Hotel is VERY close to several local attractions. It is located directly behind the Alamo, adjacent to RiverCenter Mall and only a short walk to the RiverWalk. Market Square is an approximate 10 minute walk as well. Breakfast is included from 6:30 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. Unfortunately we missed that window so I can't comment on how it was. Overall, the hotel was very nice with a great location. We will definitely consider staying at the Crockett again for a weekend getaway and plan on recommending the Crockett to out of town friends as well.",2
"The Sheraton Boston hotel is centrally located. Their club floor lounge is awesome with amazing city views. The club floor is open 24/7 with an awesome cappuccino machine and complimentary water bottles etc. It's a nice upgrade to splurge for the club floor considering it includes continental breakfast and free wireless access.
This hotel is connected to the prudential center mall and just a couple of blocks from the T and trendy Newbury street. This hotel is close to Boston University and many other universities.Parking is pricey at about $44/night, but it is about the same at most Boston hotels and there is no street parking.
The hotel is clean, well kept etc. Everyone that worked there was very helpful. I have stayed there several times and the Sheraton Boston is a reliable, consistent choice.
All in all, the Sheraton Boston hotel is a nice choice for the area.",2
i feel like they are a handsome bunch,2
"This place is probably the best dive of a Thai restaurant you can find in Las Vegas. Very vegan friendly and they have an excellent \""Thai Herbal Salad\"" specific to their establishment only that is full of punches of herbal flavor wonderland in your mouth. From coconut to lemongrass, roasted cashews to basil. Trust me you'll like it :-)",2
"Best Damn Haircut Ever. Grade: A+\n\nImma be blunt: Fellas, stop wasting your time & money on talentless hacks (the 99.9% of people who cut hair) & make this guy your regular.\n\nThis guy puts everyone else in the haircutting game to shame. Male, female, gay, straight, black, white, young or old...they all suck compared to this Italian-American dude. He is a true artist & even has a mini-statue of Michelangelo's David next to the chair (a very cool reclining chair) for inspiration or as a reminder that you're going to be walking out of there looking like a masterpiece.\n\nCalled ahead on rainy Saturday & left with the best haircut I've had in years. Hip but not hipster, classic handsome good-looking cut. All done with minimal direction from me (take the sides & back in, comb the front forward & give it some height). I went home, inspected his work & it was flawless 360! Not one missed spot (usually, for me, behind the ears), & not one follicle left untended.\n\nIncredible attention to detail, very friendly intelligent funny guy (when he was done, he said, \""Well, I've done enough damage to you...What do you think?\""), good conversation & casual vibes, all for $14...\n\nJust. \nPerfect.\n\n#ItaliansDoItBetter\n\nI am King of All Bad Haircuts no more.\n\n#Freedom",2

"Stayed here 31st March for four nights on our first trip to New York. Took the two bedroom family room in the upgraded part of the hotel - this had one large twin bedded room (no door!) and a seperate adequately sized room with queen bed. Very clean and comfortable. Equipped with two fridges with complimentary water and coke, which was a surprise. Both rooms had amazing views of the Empire State Building. The breakfast was a bit of a 'free for all' and served up on plastic plates and cutlery, however, it was more than adequate and set you up for the lenghty sightseeing ahead! Fantastic location, less than 10 minute walk to Times Square, subway on the corner and buses nearby - very easy to commute around Manhattan from here. Three Irish pubs all within 50 yards! All in all, an excellent hotel and would have no hesitation in returning - preferably soon, New York is a special place! One last mention for the roof terrace - unfortunately the bar was not open due to weather being on the cool side, but the view of the Empire State Building was something else!",2
"In a better civilization, this and many other of the David Suchet movies would be released in theaters. The plots are fabulous (no, I'd no clue who had done it, but the clues were all there if I'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the production values astounding, the acting (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds, and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, the dialogue wonderful, the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! Here were have two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony.You really can't go wrong renting these - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.I can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these Hercule Poirot/David Suchet movies. It's impossible to over-praise them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an Agatha Christie.",2
i dragged myself out of bed this morning not feeling that terrific,2
Facebook is app very beautiful app this app is all world photos and videos I am fan this app. Thanks for talk biggest man Mr. Facebook but i enjoy this face book library game,2
This hotel is near the tourist district of unionsq/market st. It is convenient to restaurants but you have to walk up a steep hill to get to it. The room is clean but nothing special and the customer service can be slow. the only plus is that they have aan adjoining restaurant where you can eat breakfast and also have a cocktail in the afternoon.,2

"My new husband and I stayed at the Ritz for our wedding night. The hotel was immaculate, and the staff was wonderful, we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. Our executive suite was amazing, we were on the 12th floor, and the champaign and chocolate covered strawberries we requested were waiting for us on arrival. There were rose petals all over the suite, leading into the bedroom, then forming a heart on the bed, which was a really nice special touch. We had two bathrooms, the master bathroom was huge, in marble and stone, with a tv built into the mirror. Bed was amazingly comfy. Uptown charlotte views were great, with the floor to ceiling windows. We snuck a peek at the gorgeous pool and hot tub on the top floor, also.
The BIG flaw is that the hotel is right across the street from the Epicenter, home to lots of bars and nightclubs. All we heard all night (until about 3AM) were police sirens, drunken people screaming, and loud base, coming from the night clubs. I couldn't fall asleep until everything shut down, even with the tv on in our room. I dont want to say that ruined the night, but it definitely had a huge negative impact.
The other minor glitch I feel is worth mentioning is that we booked under a bed and breakfast package deal, so breakfast was supposed to be included, yet sure enough, when we checked out, they had charged us for breakfast, so we had to have them take it off. To me, that shouldnt have happened, it's pretty easy to see that breakfast is supposed to be included.
I would recommend this hotel to others but ONLY if they were coming on a non-weekend night.",2
"This restaurant was truly excellent. Loved just about everything about it. Came here once months ago, do not know why I have not been back yet!\n\nOur server was very nice, it was my first time there and she took time to answer my questions fully and such. I ordered a pizza that seems to no longer be on the menu? Wondering if maybe the stuff on it is just out of season or something, because I'd be so sad if it is permanently gone! I got a pizza with butternut squash, marcona almonds, goat cheese, some sort of leafy green, a swirl of balsamic, and marcona almonda. I am completely obsessed with pizza, especially unique pizzas, and The Parlor makes a mean pizza. I inhaled the whole thing in what felt like minutes.\n\nPlanning on coming back and introducing The Parlor to my pizza-loving family members to see what they think!",2

"The show was so hilarious and funny, I almost peed in my pants and I was on stage! My sisters and I had some time to kill and after spending almost $2,000 on other shows (Love, Barry Manilow, etc) I wanted to be entertained but without costing an arm and leg. I went on Yelp and read the reviews on Mac King. I went to the show and we had the best time ever. I wonder why he isn't a headliner somewhere...maybe he will be after he keeps getting rave reviews. I can't wait to go back and take my daughter and her boyfriend. I already alerted all my friends, you will not be disappointed. His magic acts are amazing...AMAZING, and he is soooo funny, we were rolling in the aisles. Going to this show really made our trip to Las Vegas so much fun. Wish there were more shows like Mac's.",2
"Denpasar to Yogyakarta. Overall quite satisfied but seat comfort is the main issue. I can't deny that I went for the cheapest tickets. Online booking was easy. Online check-in opens 24 hours before the flight and I was able to already select seats for free which was nice. Check-in and baggage drop-off at Denpasar Bali airport was quick. We booked 15kg of baggage, one bag was slightly overweight and I didn't bother too much beforehand. The employee weighed the two bags together and it said 29.2kg so no problem at all. I printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage drop-off. Flight boarded nicely on time, about 10 o'clock before the 10.25 departure time. Pushback was at about 10.30 and takeoff just shortly thereafter. According to schedule, flight-time would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 10.20 (Java time is one hour before Bali), but we landed at about 10.40. Taxi took only a minute and 10.50 we were waiting inside on our luggage. That took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt, maybe a little long. The flight itself was boring. There is no service available. Flight attendants seemed professional though. The seat was the main letdown. A little filthy and legroom insufficient. Should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on AirAsia but felt tighter. Couldn't keep my legs straight with my 1.92m and had to bend them. Because of the short flight it was doable but I would try to avoid this seat on longer flights. I would fly Lion Air again on short flights. Our flight operated nicely on time but I hear that can also be an issue.",2

"Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams Family Values) wrote this frothy tale of a mild mannered school teacher (Kevin Kline) who is outted on the Academy Awards by a former student-turned-actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with the absurdities revolving around this setup -the effect on the town, his fiancee (Joan Cusack), himself- and climaxes with an everybody-loves-everybody finale. If you're an angry gay rights activist or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man's struggle to come out or a 'true' depiction of gay life, then save yourself the trouble and rent something else (maybe Beautiful Thing) or read a book (Giovanni's Room). If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of Tom Hanks's speech on the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and pokes fun at Hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for '30's screwball comedy (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) then enjoy! Far from being a biting satire, the film tries for the exuberance of a Preston Sturges farce and comes damn close. No, it's not 'deep' or 'powerful' -neither were Romy & Michelle, 9 to 5, or Young Frankenstein- and it doesn't pretend to be; it keeps it's tongue-firmly-in-cheek. It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale (there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire, it's like a breath of fresh air. Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderfully game while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add fine support. The excellent Joan Cusack's award winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart. The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at; personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia. I'll take harmless fluff over sanctimoniousness anytime.",2

"We stayed for 3 nights this past week at The Best Western Sunset Suites. Beautiful, old hotel built in the 1900's but all remodelled to the 2012 standards. My husband particularly enjoyed looking at the old photographs on your walls depicting earlier times.
Our room was very spacious and of course, without WIFI couldn't be sending this!
Breakfast were great but the real highlight was one particular waitress who works in the breakfast area. She was very friendly and efficient. Having a actual person in the normal help yourself buffet was wonderful. The girl at the front desk was also very helpful, calm and efficient. I am only sorry we didn't get these girls names. Job well done!",2
"The Channel Inn is in a really awesome location. It's right on the water and they have FREE parking, something unheard of in DC. We walked to the Smithsonian and to a show at the Warner Theater. Easy, fun walk.
The rooms are old looking, but if you are like me, and have plans to do things all day, all you really need is a comfy bed to come back to.
Gripes include:
1. Unfriendly staff
2. Construction was being done while I was there, and the workers started around 7:30, hammering away at the room next to us. They were also right outside of our room walking around on the roof
3. As soon as I get to any hotel I put the "" DO NOT DISTURB"" sign out on the door handle. We got a knock on the first morning there at 9:30 asking if we needed fresh towels. No, obviously, I don't. The second morning, departure day, we got a knock at 10:15, ""Are you leaving today?"" Which I'm sure they know that we are with a list of check-out's given to them in the morning from their manager's. It's a minor gripe, but I just like being left alone when I'm away.
Will definitely return. Great price and location.
A great amenity they really need is mini fridges!",2
I would give it five stars but the sound is a little off otherwise great selection of music and podcast!,2
"We've stayed at many Courtyards - this one is a bit off the beaten track but it's a good location if you're staying in NW San Antonio.
Everything was clean and the staff friendly but the hotel looks like it's due for a refurbishment. All the fixtures and furniture looked a little tired. It's in a very diverse neighborhood and there are a number of small ethnic - Tai, Indian, Middle Eastern - restaurants. That was a nice plus since most Courtyards are surrounded by chains. There is also a Starbucks close by which was good because the hotel coffee needed a make over too.
Be sure that your room does not have a door to an ajoining room. Ours did - and the baby in the room wasn't sleeping through the night.
We'll stay again when we have business in the NW Medical center area because the location can't be beat.",2

"Nice little restaurant tucked away in Bukit 0Pantai. I was greeted by Sam, a bubbly and very helpful staff. He made me feel pampered, and I was looking for being pampered as well. 5 stars for service.Started with a glass of prosecco and acqua panna. Sam served the Foccacia quickly. And it was perfectly toasted, one of the best I have had. Wanted to finish the plate but had to resist the temptation as I have save stomach room for what is to come.Had the Mangiare 21 quarter chicken to start, as I did not see anything appealing for starters. And it was a delicious chicken. Lots of flavours and roasted to perfection. Some may find the flavours a little strong but after a few bites, it becomes nice.Then I had the spinach ravioli which was superbly made and cooked in a tangy and Creamy tomato based sauce. Couldn't stop eating even though I know there is still the tiramisu coming. Compliments to the chef for this fantastic dish.",2
"Our family of 6 stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for a week in June. The accommodations were top notch. A full kitchen, washer, dryer, flatscreens with great sound system, and a fantastic view of the bay!! The modern furnishings were quite appealing to us, as were the daily chocolates left in the room....
The complimentary house car was great for trips to the grocery store or other places within their 2 mile radius. The drivers were very pleasant young men, helpful and accommodating. We used the hotels's bikes to ride across the Golden Gate Bridge and explore a bit, a very nice time. Cable Car stop was close by.
Breakfast was ok. The food choices were fine, but the buffet was not restocked often enough to accommodate the late risers. The afternoon wine time really should be extended for another hour so that guests have a bit more time to enjoy....I'm thinking that something more like the lounge options at the Waldorf or Ritz Carlton properties would be appropriate for a property such as this.
As nice as the hotel is, the outdoor section of Ghirardelli Square is a bit depressing....lots of empty storefronts...just seems a bit run down....perhaps due to the current economic conditions.
Some of the family activities we enjoyed:
Dylan's Tours (full day including Muir Woods) Fantastic!!!!
Alcatraz
Yank Sing for dim sum twice....my mouth waters just thinking about it.
running and biking along the marina and over the Golden Gate Bridge.
All in all, a nice stay....",2
"We were in vegas for the Sema show, looked up the best ramen and this ramen house came up. All four of us agreed.....it is the best! We had all the ramen options and loved them all. You can order them hot or regular...both ways are totally yummy. Fried rice if good but order it light oil. Pork belly bowl is bomb. We ate there 3days out of 5....it was that good. Options get expensive though. Enjoy!",2
"Stayed at the Philly Courtyard recently with my family. Perfect location for site-seeing being right across from City Hall and walking distace or very short cab or bus ride to all the historic sites. Also, 1 block from the Reading Terminal Market and the wide variety of food available there. No shuttle from airport to hotel, but with four people we took a cab and it was a reasonable cost and a quick ride. Very comfortable beds, large room, mini fridge, flat screen TV, good sized bathroom, no dinging elevator noises, no loud groups bumbling in at 4am and only heard the street noise once -- obnoxiously loud motorcycle. All in all a whisper quiet hotel given the locaton right next to city hall on an extremely busy street. I would ask for an upper floor though. We stayed on 11. Highly recommend this hotel for tourists, but seemed like when we were leaving on a Monday, business people were checking in. We didn't use room service or the hotel bar or restaurant. Pool was very small -- only negative. Would go back for sure. Beautiful building. I did not park(no car), but noticed it was $38/day...seemed a little expensive to me.",2

"Five fingers of death: Although previous Shaw Martial Arts epics had shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, none had paid such open tribute to it as this one, especially in the saloon fight scene. And though Shaw Bros. films had borrowed from the Japanese chambara (swordfight) genre before, none had done so with such success as this one. i suppose some of this had to do with the fact that the director originated from Korea, and thus brought a non-Chinese perspective to such borrowings, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any event, this film presented real innovations in technology and technique in Hong Kong action films. for the first time in Hong Kong, the camera was given access to the whole of any given set, which meant shots from many different angles, such as the low-angle interior shot showing the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation of which usually credited to John Ford), or the high angle long shot that allowed visualization of a large ground area, or the frontal tracking shot.It is true that this was not the first hand-to-hand combat film of real cinematic substance - that remains Wang Yu's 'Chinese Boxer'; but on a commercial level, Shaw Bros. were right to choose 'Five Fingers' as their first major release to the West because, one might say, it was the 'least Chinese' of their action films, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theater traditions. Although this made no impression on the American critics at the time (who universally trashed the picture), it wasn't lost on American audiences, especially among African Americans, whose culture had always been - by necessity - an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story, in the earnest young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to have his merit recognized. This seems to be an issue universal to Modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it; 'Five Fingers' presented it in a way many Americans could relate to as well as Chinese.So is the film now only of historical value? Certainly not. For one thing this issue hasn't gone away. Secondly, some of the innovations leave much of the film looking as fresh today as it did on first release. Also the action is well-staged, and the performances, though a little too earnest, are crisp. The film is a might over-long, but the story does cover a lot of ground. And there are marvelous set-pieces through-out, such as the saloon confrontation, the fight on the road to the contest, the odd double finale.definitely looks better on a theater screen, but still impressive for home viewing: recommended.",2

"Got a great price in advance for a Red Premier room on the top floors with a fabulous strip view, pool, Eiffel Tower, Paris Balloon, and all. My boyfriend and I spent a couple days in Planet Hollywood and a couple days in Paris just to get a couple different vibes and hotel experiences - and we ADORE Paris. We're in our mid and late 20s, and many have said this is more of a place for elderly folks to stay, but we sure enjoyed it much more than Planet Hollywood.\n\nThe room was a little on the small side, but I loved the decor. The different patterns and materials never clashed. Just watching the Bellagio fountain shows over and over and over from our windows on the adorable, cozy sofa was enjoyable enough to make the choice worth it. \n\nThe restaurants were great and I enjoyed everyone we encountered that did us even the smallest service. Vallet, front desk, bellman - everyone was funny and kind, which is a great, relaxing contrast compared to how overly and unnecessarily rude and brute a lot of workers for taxi lines and clubs in Las Vegas are.

"DAD's bagels is my life-saver. Emergency breakfasts, nothing for lunch? A fresh straight out of the wood-fired oven bagel cannot be beat. When I get them hot I usually eat them straight out of the bag, and rarely get fancy with anything more than some whipped cream cheese.\n\nIf, on rare occasion, I am unable to get the hot bagels, I will toast them lightly and use them for a sandwich. The bagels at DAD's are more substantial than your usual Montreal bagels, so they hold up well to being packed with smoked salmon, some ham or even some sliced chicken. \n\nThis shop also sells ready to reheat indian food, several pastries, sandwiches and a few other. almost random, items. Whenever I have shown even the slightest of interest in any of their Indian foods, they end up giving me something. I don't know. What I have had has been really good, but I've never actually bought (paid for) any of their Indian foods. \n\nI rarely buy anything but the bagels and cream cheese, but sometimes, if I am stuck for breakfast, I know I can buy eggs, or cream, or bacon, or juice. Very convenient as they are open 24/7.\n\nThey've got my vote for the best bagel in Montreal.",2

I think this is a lovely family movie. There are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout.

"I probably would have given this hotel a 4 out of 5 - but the amazing customer service I experienced put this place over the edge. Everyone, the bellman, front desk, servers, room service etc. went out of their way to make sure I was happy and taken care of. The roof top bar is not to be missed. There was a local musician doing a show in the lounge on Friday night - nice touch. This is an older hotel, but they have really made an effort to update the guest rooms with nice dark wood and granite. However, the windows are old and a bit drafty. My room on the 25th floor had a fantasic view of the harbor and other nearby builings. There isn't a lot in the immediate few blocks, but I was easily able to walk to the Seattle Art Museum, Pioneer Park, the Waterfront and other tourist sites.",2

"A few years ago I stayed at the Beacon Hotel (just a couple of blocks down Broadway from the Milburn) right after it reopened following a major renovation. It was then really cheap and I loved it. Especially the kitchenette (in every room)--I'm one of those visitors to New York who likes to shop for and eat the same foods New Yorkers do: fruit, pastries, deli take-outs, bagels, etc. etc. This requires somewhere to store food and preferably some plates and utensils to eat with. So the Beacon was great, but it has become way too expensive for me. I consider myself very lucky to have now found the Milburn. Same great location for groceries--Zabar's is just north on Broadway, Fairway just south! And kitchenettes! OK, so the kitchenettes aren't quite as good as the Beacon's. You do, however, get a fridge, a microwave, a sink and some basic dishes. And you get a clean room, a mostly renovated bathroom (for some reason, probably cost, they chose to put in new sinks and tile but not new toilets or tubs or shower tile). Great central air conditioning. And a very spacious room. For (in my case), less than $200 per night. And free breakfast is included--with real New York bagels, good pastries, better than average coffee, yogurt, fruit, toast, etc. What a deal! Only downside: the mattress was way too soft. If I had stayed longer, I would have asked to change to a room with a firmer bed.",2

"I am a HUGE Brazilian BBQ fan and this place is the top of the heap thus far..\n\nThe salad bar is the size of a classroom. It has everything you can imagine on it, cheeses, spreads, breads, olives, multiple salads, did I say cheese? You could have a quality dinner just off of it.\n\nThen, the meat comes. I was smart enough to avoid the temptation to stuff myself from the salad bar and wait for the steak and it was worth it. Just some of the best meats Iv had in a while..\n\nAnd , for reference, lets talk about how the meat is cooked: OVER A FIRE. If you want something well done, thats towards the outside. If you want it rare (bloody for me), that will be on the inside. If you don't tell the guy who's carving which you want, you'll get whatever happens to be next in line on the chopping block. So don't complain about the steak being over/under cooked, just pipe up and tell them what you want. \n\nDeserts were equally as wonderful. We had one of each on our table of about a dozen. Top it off with an espresso and I was ready and willing to take a long nap in a hot tub.\n\nFor the money (it's a few bucks more than Samba) do yourself a favor and take a cab down the strip and eat here. And make sure you're hungry.",2

"... it's definitely not for everyone. Depends on where your priorties lie.
My daughter goes to college in SF, and I found this place by accident online (location/price combo). I have stayed here 4 times now. It is a quirky place, and as we know if we like the quirks we find them charming, and if they don't they bug the hell out of us. Some of these other reviews indicate as much.
The location (just above Union Square) is unbeatable. The structure is an old 6-floor building that doesn't seem to to have been updated for ages. (This hotel has been family owned and run for decades. They live here still.) Again, I don't mind that the furniture looks like it came from a 1940s rummage sale. You might. There is charm everywhere here including the elevator which dates back to like 1915.
The staff is pleasant but decidedly hands off. Though I have stayed here 4 times in the past 6 months, they have no idea who I am or that I have been here before. That's a little weird. But it's okay. :-)
The rooms are of radically different size and are grouped (and priced) accordingly. The small rooms are barely (barely) big enough for one adult person. Don't be cheap and try to put two people in one of those (despite the fact that it'll say ""Queen bed""). If there are two of you, get a large room. The large rooms are decent size -- downside is, they have awkwardly packed in too many pieces of the rummage sale furniture which makes the room feel crowded still.
Breakfast is free (except for the tip) and fast (no menus, french toast or eggs, plus juice and coffee). I only eat it 1/2 the time because it's too early for me (7:30-9 weekdays; 8:30-10 weekends) but for those here on business I guess you're up and out anyway so why not. They also offer free wireless internet which is very cool.
I am a total priss about getting my sleep, and let me tell you I sleep great here no matter where my room is. And I nap in the late afternoon too. Yes you can often hear the city outside, including the cable car bells over on Powell, but it's a cool noise, and as I say sleeping is easy.
So ultimately I would say, if you are looking for super-modern amenities and outgoing personnel, this is not the Hyatt. But if you want something from a somewhat lost era, with some old-world charm, stay here. (I am writing this from my room -- I check out today!) And I'll be back... even if they don't remember me!",2

Arrivati nel bel mezzo del traffico di San Francisco, abbiamo posteggiato la macchina di fronte alle porte d’ingresso del Fusion e consegnato le chiavi al receptionist durante il check-in, hanno provveduto poi loro a spostarla nel garage per i 2 giorni che ci ospitavano (il costo per questo servizio è di 35$ al giorno). L’accoglienza è stata professionale e concisa, la stanza però un po’ diversa dalle aspettative : molto, troppo piccola. Per chi come noi viaggia on the road non può permettersi di disfare la valigia ogni tappa e purtroppo non vi era lo spazio sufficiente per poterla aprire se non sopra il letto. Ricorda tanto le camere Parigine. In compenso impera la pulizia.
La colazione è stata un’altra delusione. Avevamo la camera al 4°piano e durante il check-in ci è stato detto di recarci per far colazione al 5° piano, alla camera 522 : ebbene si, si tratta di una piccolissima camera con 2 tavolini posti l’uno di fronte all’altro con qualche dolcetto, succhi di frutta e macchina per il caffè. Con il tuo vassoio devi poi tornare in camera per consumare il pasto in quanto la stanzetta non riesce ad ospitare né sedie né più di 4 persone alla volta. Purtroppo per un soggiorno di 2 giorni e per l’alta somma pagata, non ne è valsa troppo la pena.",2

"The best innovation in the world,thanks alot from openai",2
"We had the most amazing server!! He was so attentive to our needs. The biggest thing I noticed is when he came by to take our order, he would notice that we were talking and he would make a round to come back again. He didn't want to disrupt the conversation. It was so polite!!\nThe food was also great. Between the four of us, not one of us had a complaint. I would for sure go again and I would tell others to go as well. \nOh and the atmosphere is super fun too :)",2
"I just returned from a 3 day, 3 night stay at the Biltmore (Wed - Sat) and I think there were tears in my eyes when I pulled away last evening! It was truly a pleasure from the moment I checked in until I left. I paid in advance for a deluxe resort room in the Valley wing which was large with a lovely balcony overlooking Camel Mountain to the left and the large lawn and a glimpse of the Paradise Pool to the right.
I was travelling alone (woman, mid 30s) and the staff made extra sure I was comfortable regardless of what I was doing. They remembered me from the front desk, to the restaurant, to the pool. Normally when I travel, I use the hotel for sleeping only, this was not the case for this vacation. The only time I left the resort was when I went shopping on Friday at the Biltmore Fashion Park (free shuttle service) and the Fashion Square (5 miles down on Camelback Rd).
Two of the evenings I ate on the outdoor patio of Wright's Bar and was able to order food from the Grille. I also spent 2 full days in a cabana by the pool where the staff were attentive and lovely and I also had a terrific, relaxing massage at the spa one of the early evenings.
Because I was there mid-week through the weekend, I noticed a huge difference in clientele. Mostly business men and women Wed-Fri and then families on the weekend. The pool was much livelier on Saturday and I recommend splurging for the cabana to escape from the noise and sun if necessary.
I loved my stay here and would recommend it to single travellers or families. I hope to return for many more vacations.",2
i feel deeply and truly content,2
"Nauru to Pohnpei. Small but friendly airline. The seat configuration was 3+3 and the legroom was OK for my 6ft frame. No real in-flight entertainment. On the relatively short-haul island hopping, only snacks were served but there was beer and wine. The best feature of this airline were the charming cabin crew, clad in blue and I thought of them as Angels in Blue.",2
"We made a reservation at Brick Tops for Queen's Feast. The table was ready for us when we arrived early, our dining partners were held up in traffic and were 15 minutes late. Restaurant Week is a busy time for many of the nice places in Charlotte, but we were treated to the superior service and fabulous food we have enjoyed in the past, even though it was Restaurant Week and they were very busy. We were not rushed at all, the food was perfectly cooked and we had a relaxing and enjoyable meal. PLUS, we could hear each other speak at the table. We could actually have a conversation! This is so rare today with all the restaurants doing nothing to quiet the sound. I would pick Brick Tops any time we want a nice meal out with friends. Absolutely loved it and so did our friends who had never been there. I will sing their praises to anyone who will listen!",2

"Man oh man what can I say. First of all, reading all these negative reviews makes me so sad! I absolutely love this place and adore the owners and Ace, the sushi chef, he is incredible! I have been coming to Kokoro for the last year practically every Wednesday for lunch and I have never been let down! Every person I bring with me or suggest to come on their own would agree with me. The food is always fresh, service is timely, I'm always greeted by a friendly face, and their restaurant is always clean. I always look forward to my Wednesday lunch date with Kokoro's sushi. I usually order Edamame, the Las Vegas Roll, and the Caterpillar Roll. When my friend comes with me she usually orders the Honey Sesame Chicken or the Teriyaki Chicken. Both of our meals are a hardy helping and we are both satisfied and full when we leave. I can't tell you how obsessed I am with their Las Vegas Roll. I consider myself a sushi connoisseur of sorts. I've lived in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area for 10 years now and have tried many sushi spots. Kokoro, hands down, has the best Las Vegas Roll in the valley. I will continue to recommend Kokoro sushi as one of the best places to get sushi in the Phoenix area!",2

Everything was so fresh and had so much flavor: quinoa, big pieces of avocado, feta cheese mmmmmmm I had a bean soup on a side and it was great too - cilantro made it taste so good. Staff was super friendly: refilled water, and asked us a couple of times if everything was ok. The only thing I don't understand why they had electronic music playing lol",2

"Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of `The Life' for free. Neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run scams because they can't make it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they're just lazy. This simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, produced, and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all hoodlums have nicknames), and is based on his play, `Riff Raff.' It feels like a play from beginning to end, especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted. Often times the dialog comes very fast, much faster than it would on stage, and I think it's the film's biggest flaw. Mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street, a sort of iambic pentameter rap, that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses. The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these hoodlums who murder, cheat, and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all. One is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders, or even laughs, at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise.",2

"Great set at an amazing price!!
I can't believe the price of this set, given the quite nice furniture that you get for it! I looks great and performs just perfectly! It came in many (some heavy) boxes, and fortunately our set only got 2 tiny blemishes that are not visible from the front (a little scratch and a little dent on the inside face of one drawer). It was fairly easy to put together, all you have to do is follow the instructions. But since the instructions are only graphics, I can see how some people would have a more difficult time with it. However, I want to stress is not hard at all. It is time consuming though. I would like to see manufacturers find a different packing material than styrofoam, because little particles of the stuff gets stuck EVERYWHERE and it's a pain to clean. Also it's not environmentally friendly and can't be recycled. Other than that, we are very happy with this set and you can seriously NOT beat that price!!",2
"An Amazing venue! It is a must see. Beautiful brick with high ceilings and a gorgeous 2rd story over looking it. They are a one stop shop with the owner also having a catering company, bar, wedding business. They are so nice and caring there. \n\nI was an activities planner for 6 years and this would have been my dream location. You can utilize so many parts of it separately or all together to make a massive event. \n\nSeriously, Yelp is for people to find good business, and if you pass this one up without giving it a chance, you will loose out.",2

"What makes this one better than most ""movie movies"" is that it doesn't feel phony. The film the story of the hot-headed director and his rise and fall and rise, by using real recognizable names and events during the silent and early sound eras. Instead of the generic ""sound will put us out of business"" business, they actually SHOW Jolson and ""The Jazz Singer"". The acting is really quite good, with believeable performances from Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.",2
"This is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. Some of the scenes are very funny. I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. Some of the dresses are really beautiful, pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in colour. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. Watch it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.",2

The staff was great; friendly, professional and helpful. One day I wanted to see Napa Valley, not realizing it was 8 hours away from San Diego. The staff suggested another wine country area, Temecula, which was much closer and also enjoyable.
I was quite satisfied with my stay at this Hilton.",2

We previously used VIP Landscaping and thought we had a decent company. We had some irrigation drip problem and VIP gave us a quote. Well I'm glad we got a second opinion! Ultimate Landscaping quoted us at half the price and they did even more work. So then we asked about their landscaping price and again we were amazed how much cheaper they are than VIP. Been using them 3 months and I have no complaints! We've gone through three companies and Ultimate is by far the best.,2

"I checked into this hotel in February. They advertise ""Newly Renovated"". They rooms are EXACTLY the same. They updated the lobby and restaurant, but nothing else. I was paying almost $40.00 more a night with the ""Government Discount"", and when I asked to have my rate lowered to the $99.00 rate they were offering I was told ""No"". I checked out and went ONE BLOCK up the street to the Holiday Inn Express Mira Mesa, and enjoyed the rest of my stay in San Diego. I was given a rate of almost 50% LESS ONE BLOCK up the street.",2

"Everyone we encountered in this place was concerned that our stay be great... We were upgraded because the hotel was not full; lake-view room and comped for 2 drinks in the bar. Sweet.. I have read many of the other reviews and am in agreement, esp. about the weird bathroom window shutters and slatted door. All bodily function sounds are shared into the sleeping area. Strange and I am at a loss to describe it adequately. I also found the walls not to be sound-proofed. Enviable noises which left little to the imagination for 1/2hr our 1st night (only). Wonderful pool on the 7th floor. Apples in the lobby and near the pool and exercise area. Clean, clean, clean!!! Concierges were GREAT.. I cannot say enough about each of them. Accurate and concerned, often inquiring about our activities upon our return. A car is available by appointment, a advert for Accura. We used this service to get to an eatery and to go to Union Station for the train back to Michigan and the drivers were very good and full of information. Music in the pool, lobby and lifts was incessant and loud to the point of irritation. WiFi is an extra cost in the rooms but free in the lobby, called the living room by staff. I'd return if near the price we had.",2
"We chose this motel because it is close to where our son and daughter-in-law live but trust me, we had our doubts. From the photo on their web site and the economical rates, we knew it would be ""modest"" but we wanted to be close to the kids while visiting.
We were very pleasantly surprised. Our room had been recently remodeled and it was clean, comfortable and even nice. A very comfortable bed!
A good rate is no good if it's a bad place but the Geary Parkway Motel made saving money quite nice. We saw other travelers just like ourselves there, and that increases your comfort.
A bus route in front of the motel made it easy to get downtown and other places. And the manager (quite nice) helped us arrange transportation to the airport.
Bottom line: we'll stay there again.",2

Although we were not able to settle my claim easliy due to issues with the insurance company, Steve made the deposition and arbitration process easy and tolerable. \n\nEven down to the payment of my final settlement check, everyone at Henness and Haight was courteous, professional, returned calls promptly, and took the time to get to know me as a person, not just a case.

"Okay. Here's the deal. Enough of the froo-frooness of some of these reviews and the sheer audacity of others.
Cut to the chase: CALL BEFORE YOU COME to notify them you are coming in late or that you WANT THE ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR (you are adults and should be doing this anyway before you visit a hotel to make sure they even have your reservations.)
-Politely ask for a room on the top floor- minimizing overhead foot traffic.
-the contintental breakfast is a ""Sam's Club"" danish and some juice/coffee/hot cocoa. So what. it's not as though you're paying $200 a night for this place. it's a mom and pop thing (when they are there- that's later) they aren't chargin' for parking, so take that money and have a nice breakfast down the street.
-the parking spots are narrow. however, when we were there and every room was filled, and people couldn't park right, we were allowed to park in one of two handicapped spots. there are more spots than rooms.
they can also make a phone call to have someone come and re-park their car, if you ask nice.
-Because the photos don't show it, what this place is is, well picture an three layered oval (uncovered in the middle) (like a doughnut) the top two layers are rooms. the doors open up into the middle. the lowest level is where you park. so, if an idiot sets off his car alarm or some parents don't teach their children to respect hotels and use their ""inside"" voice, yes you can hear stuff. but i don't think it is nearly what people are making it out to be.
-this hotel is pretty much near everything you want. 2 blocks to the trolley which will take you pretty much everywhere. it will also take you to the bus line for places further out.
-the mom and pop who are there most of the time bring in another gentleman when they go away on family business, trips, etc. they are working too and from speaking with them, a heck of a lot. Now, i DO agree with the fact that they know a little bit more about where to eat, thing to do etc. but the young gentleman i just as good.. just give him some idea of what you want. saying ""uh, anything"" gives no one a chance.
- the place is clean as a whistle. the rooms are quite large for those of you toting kids.
-the price can't be beat (you've no doubt read about the free parking)
-the pizza place down and around the corner rocks.
i guess just use a little common courtesy and common sense and you'll probaly see it for the money saving gem it is. you get what you pay for. if you are looking for lux, go somewhere else. if you are looking for clean comfort on a budget-- give this place a try!!",2
"It's going on 5 years now that we've used the Westin New York Times Square for our corporate meetings and guest rooms. We love staying there...perfect location. They are just one block over from Broadway and Times Square which is great for 2 reasons. 1) It's right near everything!! 2) Because it's one block over, it's just a tad more peaceful. You've got the best of both worlds. Great views from the rooms too. Get yourself a suite, you'll be glad you did!!
Now for meetings, it's a great place to have a meeting or reception. There's a variety of meeting and ballrooms that can fit almost any need. The service is excellent and what you would come to expect from a Westin. The food doesn't disappoint either. The on sight restaurants and bar are great too and this hotel is attached to a movie theater with other restaurants as well.

I stayed here again for a week while in Houston on Business May 2012 and what an improvement! I was really impressed with everything from the lobby décor to the service standards of the staff. I asked for a few different things including a change of room because of external traffic noise (not the fault of the hotel of course), a late check-out, use of a secure deposit box etc. and every time the hotel staff exceeded my expectations at no charge.
In my opinion this is now a great hotel and I would recommend it to anybody who is planning to visit Houston.",2

"It's great to have this place in the neighborhood. I take my mom here on Saturdays and Sundays and sometimes throughout the week. They are incredibly accommodating as they will adjust any dish and just serve us half a serving (their portions are large). My mom loves the coffee here and has it with a shot of whipped cream. This gives it a creamy taste with just a touch of sugar. Some of their exceptional offerings include the Cuban sandwich, crepes, baby back ribs (there are regulars that will just not miss a Friday night because of them), the hamburgers, and of course the She Crab soup, there are of course many others. Their daily offering of soup of the day is usually good also. There is a list of special brunch items on the weekends, but if you don't like what's there, they will always find something you will love. The staff is very friendly and feels more like family. Not a disagreeable one in the bunch. Highly recommend this place.",2
"ok first off i booked the hudson months back and then read the most awful reviews regarding this hotel, and i was very tempted to cancel my stay. however it went ahead and from arrival to departure 6 days later i can honestly say that the people who give negative reviews may well have there own gripes but i had none...yes its trendy hip cool place to be seen if you're into that way of life but seriously..come on..its a hotel..a crash pad..new york is the city that never sleeps so why stay in your room?..
we were greeted by friendly staff and given our room keycard and pass to bar / club - we didnt use the bar / club, there are so many other places to go, and whenever we passed by it we knew the place wasn't our sort of thing..we had a queen room with air con.. window that opened.. shower and bath and yes its small but its a bathroom!!.. our bed was totally comfy and was made up for us each day.. yes the room is fairly small but it is a bedroom!!.. a hotel is a hotel is a hotel.. its a place to rest your head and wash away the day..come on..its a hotel!!!....... we had a great stay, no problems, flame diner over the road is open 24/7 go over there and eat or get take out and eat in your room.. the mini-bar is pricey.. but whooooo uses one in any hotel they are always pricey!!...the staff, yes some of them are wannabees but do i really care...NO..im happy in my world!!
I would recommend the hudson to any age group-its a great hotel great location great decor and preferable to a stuffy chintz and lace affair any day.",2

The hotel employes were all so welcoming. My room was very clean and comfortable, the bathroom was very unique. I really liked the wood floors and the floor to ceiling windows. The free wifi was really nice to have in the room. I could hear doors closing and light talking in the hallways at times.
I was in walking distance to anywhere I needed be. There was a 7-11, Trader Joe's, Whole foods and my favorite Giordano's pizza few blocks away.",2
Super clean and super nice staff. They give you cookies when you check in and they are unreal. I think they give them to you whenever you ask but I tried to restrain myself. Rooms are very big and decorated very well. Everything seems new. It's great. The lounge downstairs is cool just to walk through. But the food and drinks are really worth staying. Top notch hotel. I don't dress very nice and they still treated me like I was a king.,2

It is located 1 block from the Larimer restaurant/bar district and within walking distance to Coors Field

"We stayed five nights at the Metro - the bed was a bit on the hard side and the air conditioning too noisy to leave on overnight, but it was clean and the staff very friendly and the location was great just off Broadway and five minutes walk from Times Square - very close to the subway with connections in all directions. The room itself had no view (they put us on the back which was supposedly quieter so all we could see were brick walls) but the view from the roof terrace was compensation enough - a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. The free breakfast was good too - bagels, toast, muffins etc and free tea and coffee 24 hours a day. The public areas are lovely - art deco and very stylish.",2
"I can't begin to tell you how fabulous this museum is. I went on a friend's recommendation, and was blown away by the organization and thoroughness of the displays.\n\nThe upstairs level is organized by continent, and each country has its own display of instruments from their region. Most also have a video screen, and as you approach the display, your headset automatically begins to play music from the country. Walk to the next display, and your headset plays the next country's music.\n\nDownstairs there is a room that features many important musicians from past and present. Another room gives you the opportunity to try multiple unique instruments.\n\nThis is a fabulous place to take your older children, probably about 2nd-3rd grade is the youngest I would take. There is so much to see, it may take you two visits to see everything!",2
"What a beautifull hidden gem in Melaka this is. The food was very good. Prices were quite fine as well for western standards.

Booked right through the Hotel 373 website and got complimentary breakfast at the Oxford Cafe, which is right next door, for each morning. Appreciate that so, so much!!
The cheapest souvenir store we found in Manhattan (and we were in quite a few!!) was two doors down, just on the other side of the Oxford Cafe.",2
Awesome food and Superb service,2
"We missed the side road the first time. Pay attention once your are on Santa Monica Blvd going west and crossed Westwood, stay far right and turn immediately into a side road. A few free parking spots in the front but plenty more in the back of the Inn. This is an excellent more economical place to stay if you are visiting UCLA and all the hotels in Westwood are fulled. The reception was friendly, the rooms were newly refurbished, clean and comfy. Complimentary breakfast was good fresh standard fare. We stayed Saturday night, the place was quiet and restful. Good alternative for us when we visit UCLA.",2

"We arrived evening into LAX from a 14 hour flight. Rang the hotel for shuttle pickup , which they advised we would be picked up in 15 minutes , which we were. Reception was friendly and quick. Our room (206) was clean and tidy, bed & bathroom were fine, also the free WiFi was handy. We had to fly out the next day so early to bed. Breakfast in the morning was continental style and all that one needed to start the day. , checkout was friendly and quick. Promptly at 8, our free shuttle arrived to take us back to LAX. Super 8 LAX is a great budget airport hotel, and doesn't pretend to be anything more than that, as the name suggests you are near the airport so there is aircraft flying near by, which we personally didn't mind. We wouldn't have any problem staying here again or recommending it to other people.",2

"Já fui algumas boas vezes a Los Angeles e sempre quando ia na calçada da fama olhava o Roosevelt. Tinha a impressão se ser um baita hotel. Que nada! Em minha última passagem a L.A resolvi finalmente me hospedar por lá. Que decepção!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pelo preço você acha que ele é pelo menos legal. Quartos antigos e péssimo espaço. O banheiro é MINÚSCULO e esquisito. O chuveiro é junto da banheira e o boxe(embaçado de sujeira)) só vai até a metade servindo de nada porque quando termina-se o banho o chão está alagado! Meu amigo, teve um problema em sua reserva e foi lhe oferecido um upgrade com os quartos virados pra piscina. Beeeeeem melhor do que os quartos dos prédios mas mesmo assim brega e de mal gosto. Sem contar que rolava pool parties que não o deixava dormir bem. Enfim, pura decepção! Nas ruas próximas oferecem-se hoteis baratos do memso nivel do roosevelt se não melhores. Custo benefício bem melhor. Sem contar que de locolização não há quase diferença. Não indico a ninguém!",2

"Excellent service from start to finish.
Put my item in to sell I was given a price which I was more than happy with, added my details and within a couple of days my pack arrived to send my item in.
It was received and within 2 days the money was paid into my account. They kept me updated and it was a very efficient service.
I would highly recommend Envirofone and will definitely be using them again.",2
"I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn't swim, AND none of them could get out.John's character saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them right to the very end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's eventual love interest. She was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.",2
"First let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall...",2

"Io e la mia famiglia abbiamo scelto l'hotel Belvedere proprio per la posizione, l'hotel si trova sulla 48 strada a pochissimi passi da Time Square, Broadway ecc.,quindi si raggiungevano a piedi tranquillamente. L'hotel si presenta bene, anche se le camere sono un po' datate. Noi abbiamo avuto un "" problemino ""di scarico ma comunque risolto in breve tempo.La colazione troppo costosa! Noi uscivamo e nelle vicinanze trovavamo cio' che ci serviva. Dunque un hotel senza troppe pretese ma in ottima posizione !",2
"Have stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza before so I knew the hotel would meet all my expectations. Spent the 4th of July night there and was checked in promptly with no issues. One negative (though minor but still rare for a top notch hotel like the Copley Plaza) was that the staff was not attentive when we walked in with bags. No attempt to help us and even after checking in ... no attempt to bring our bags up to our room (the front desk didn't even ask if we had bags and if we needed help). It's an oversight worth noting (even though I am very capable of handling my own bag) because you would not expect this and never experienced it prior. The room was laid out perfectly and plenty of space. Another minor thing that completely stood out was the half empty bottle of water just sitting on the table. Big oversight for a first rate hotel (and a bit gross since it leads you to question how thorough they clean). The room did appear clean though and the bed was comfortable. Ordered room service and it came up promptly and hit the spot. We ordered extra towels and said we would be leaving the room and to leave them on the bed. No one delivered them. We called again and eventually got them upon our return. The small ""misses"" are noted because of the hotel wanting to be a 5 star facility and my prior experience being so positive. Had breakfast the next day in the Oak Room and it was excellent.",2
"I traveled to San Antonio with a friend who RAVED over Starwood properties (Westin, W Hotel, La Meridian were all hotels she had stayed in), so i couldnt wait to see this property. However, i was VERY surprised at what i saw. I guess i am not ""up"" with the whole Manhattan loft concept, but i don't think this is great for an extended stay for a woman in her 40's and up who is used to the comforts of home.
Yes, it was clean, but as others have stated here on reviews, the walls inside the room are THIN--it essentially feels like one room with partitions. Not to be too gross, but if you are in the room when someone else is in the bathroom, since there is NO exhaust fan to mask sounds....let's just say--you can hear everything--best turn that 42"" TV up !
The beds were comfortable, and in general, i didn't hear any of the hall or parking lot noise others mentioned (we were on the 3rd floor), so sleeping was good overall. i think that room cleaning could have been better, i am used to the room looking like it had never been used (esp. in the bathroom) with all amenities replenished when you return to the room. We had to ask several times for extra towels for the 3 of us, and, unless you put the towels on the floor, they didn't tend to bring enough back. and what's with that midget ironing board??!?!
Also, having both a refrigerator AND a Microwave would have been better, especially for those who are staying longer than 2-3 nights, cause it can get irritating going up and down the elevator reheating foods. Just a thought.
I think the foods in the ""re:fuel"" snack bar were WAY overpriced, so the only thing i had was coffee in the room...
Overall, i think this concept is geared for the younger crowd, but not what i expected from a hotel that has hotels like La Meridian and the W. The price was right for the hotel (we got a ""hot rate""), so if i would have paid more, i think i would have been more disappointed... i would recommend only really for the location; Target, Dennys, Pappadeaux, Wal-mart and the North Star Mall, were all very nearby. There are a LOT of places to go to up and down the 410 highway. Getting back and forth to the the hotel can be confusing, so bring your GPS!! :-)",2

"I rarely give out 5 stars to hotels but this one deserves it. The hotel is perfectly located near the White House and Metro. It has a great bar and a wonderfully unusual French atmosphere that makes this hotel stand out. (Since Sofitel is a French chain this should not surprise but it's done very well here). If you're sick of cookie cutter properties, stay here.",2

"Good Value for Brazil Nuts
I am greatly impressed with the fact these are processed in a facility with only tree nuts. Aside from that, the taste is very good and the volume is a great value for the price. My only criticism would be the initial bag seal on one of the bags I ordered. It wasn't sealed, and that is upsetting. The other bag was sealed, so I can assume it is likely a manufacturing issue. In the future please ensure these bags are sealed!!",2

"The place was very nice very clean the room was super comfy and cozy. I can honestly say if you avoid some people at the front desk your experience would be 5 stars. Most of the staff is very polite except for one man at the front desk always rude. When I arrived one of the keys i was given did not work I realize that later on that day when i tried to use it. I went downstairs to ask for another key. I was not angry i was pretty happy with the room I was looking toward everything we had planned, so i was in a good mood. he started accusing me that because i had my key next to my phone it got demagnetized. I explained i did not that i had both keys in the envelop he gave me and that one worked the other did not. He continued to pretty much scold me like i was a kid. I'm trying to not lose it so i put my phone down it happen to be right next to the key and then he goes you see you put it next to your phone just like that and that is why it doesn't work. so now I'm confused does he want me to pay for another key?? if so say so charge me don't yell at me. I asked him do i have to pay for another one if not then can i have the key?
he finally gave me the key. I had to encounter him a few other times and the same treatment i tried avoiding the front desk when he was there. If you do go just avoid him and it will be a pleasant stay.",2

I had new foods tonight that I've never even heard of! Delicious appetizer to start with of Hummus and Baba Ganoush. That was super yummy!\nThey had $5 burgers tonight. It was a chirizo beef patty with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and a spicy mayo...served with shoestring fries. Total experience was fabulous. I was impressed with the service, the quality of the food and the total atmosphere. \nI will visit again.",2

"We stayed here the night before boarding ship for an Alaska cruise. The location is right next door to the cruise terminal @ pier 66 (for NCL cruises). Arriving at night, the view of the harbour and city is fabulous, and waking up and pulling the drapes to see your cruise ship is wonderful. The water facing balcony room is more expensive, but if you can afford it...it's worth it. The room is huge with a big flat screen TV.
Since we got in late, we ordered from the room service menu and the fish and chips was plentiful, fresh and delicious.
The service in the dining room for breakfast was a little slow, but we had a rookie waitress. The people in the hotel are all very friendly and guest services were very helpful with giving me directions to walk to Pike Place Market which is a about a 10 minute walk. Check out the market, it is really cool with cheap bouquets of flowers ($5 - $15!!), seafood, restaurants and the usual t-shirt, knick knacks, artwork and jewellry. There is a shuttle from the hotel to downtown as well.
The day of the cruise, the bell hop took our luggage to the terminal, so we simply walked to the ship...and saved the cost of a cab!
The novelty and convenience of staying at The Edgewater is well worth the cost IMO.",2

"Primanti's is a local food. For anyone like me who grew up in the Pittsburgh area, your brain is already hardwired for borderline obsession with this product. However, if you're a first-timer, you might love it, you might hate it. Or maybe it will take you a few tries and it will grow on you. That seem to be the case for any regional fare. If it were a food that everyone instantly loved, Primanti's would be a national chain. But thank goodness it's not, because the nostalgia of this Pittsburgh, blue-collared staple would be lost anywhere outside the city. (But who am I kidding, I'd probably visit the Florida locations, too, if I were in the area.) \n\nYou may not love it, but you owe it to yourself to at least try it.",2
"I recently flew with Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Denmark through Singapore return trip with my 4-year old.
As it turned out, I got caught in the SAS pilot strike on a connecting flight when I had to return to Melbourne, and if it hadn't been for Singapore Airlines' brilliant customer service, I would have been stuck! Within 6 hours of emailing Singapore Airlines, I had a customer representative calling me offering me an alternative flight home, re-booked at NO EXTRA COST!! I am super impressed and grateful, and this is one of the reasons why I ALWAYS try to book Singapore Airlines before any other airlines!
Service and comfort on board the flights (MEL - SIN, SIN - CPH and AMS - SIN, SIN - MEL) were great with extra attention being paid to my pre-schooler with plenty of chats and making sure he was entertained. The child meals are also great, and I find it fantastic that they are served first, about 20-30 min before the normal meal service, giving a parent the chance to help feed the kid first and be able to eat my own meal while warm :-)",2

"Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film. A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost. Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one, and survived.",2

Frost is by far my favorite dessert place. Every flavor I have ever tried was delicious. Of course I have my favorites like the Sea Salt Caramel and the Bellini! So good! There is usually a line and its usually out the door. It always goes very fast even though the employees behind the counter let you try as many flavors as you want. I love that they pass out cups of water while you are in line or sitting down enjoying your gelato. This place is always clean and well kept. A family favorite and we frequent Frost often.,2

The ambient lighting was we wanted, the waiter came by and handed our menus after looking at them for what seemed like forever we asked which meals was the best seller. We had a combo meal. One thing that bothered me was the wait staff seemed a little too eager to help or clear our table, I was still eating when they took my plate away. The portions were the right size, due to having had stomach surgery a few weeks ago. About 11pm the power went out, we couldn't get our receipt for the meal which I am told is quite common in Malaysia.",2

"The hotel is located in downtown Ft. Worth, directly across from the Ft. Worth Water Gardens and the convention center. While on the outer edge of the downtown area the hotel is still very convenient to shops and restaurants that you can either walk to if you don't mind a little exercise or using the free Molly Trolley which stops directly outside the hotel. The staff is very helpful and I received service above and beyond by Steven , one of the bell captains who has been working in Ft. Worth hotels for over 20 years.
My room was clean and comfortable and with free wi-fi, a pretty good value as well.
If I had one complaint it would be the lobby coffee shop which served up overpriced pastries and drinks, but that is pretty common amongst most hotels.
If you are staying in Ft. Worth this property is definitely worth considering.",2
"I previously saw the mus.i.c show at the MGM Grand and wasn't sure if there was going to be a big difference compared to the show at Monte Carlo. But since I enjoyed the show so much the last time, I decided to go watch it again. If you get tickets early, you can probably find some discount through the Monte Carlo website, I got my tickets for 30% off. I definitely recommend sitting in the main floor close to the center aisle so that you get a full view of everything that's going on. \n\nThe show is a bit different from the show at the MGM, the production value is higher so the costumes and the set got an upgrade. If you've seen the show at the MGM, the story line is about the same but they added some new routines and the best part, they took off their masks at the end =), not sure if they are doing that at the end if every show or what but they didn't do that before. \n\nThe Monte Carlo theatre is bigger and the seats are like the movie theater seats (all individual). At the Hollywood theatre at the MGM, some seats were in a booth and they packed 6 people into one tiny booth and it was a uncomfortable but the Hollywood theatre was smaller so it felt more intimate there. But definitely check this show out =), the tickets are very reasonable for a Vegas show, they even have meet and greet passes but no discount for those =(.",2
"We recently stayed for 4 nights at the Casablanca Hotel and we would go as far as saying it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff were so friendly and helpful from the time we arrived we were a bit early to check in but they told us to help ourselves to the refreshments until the room was ready, they knew the visit was partly for my parents Ruby wedding anniversary and they left a complimentary bottle of wine in the room, a nice touch. The room was on the 6th floor and was quiet with all the facilities you would want and a good size room, the turn down at night with new towels etc was also appreciated. The complimentary refreshements during the day were also appreciated when returning from a day out or evening at theatre. Location could not be better yards from times square yet well sound proofed and quiet. Would definitely recommend and would certainly like to come again!!",2

"Ce n'est pas le meilleur Marriott ou Residence Inn que nous ayons pu pratiqué (le SpringHill Suites est dans le même immeuble). Nous avions réservé une ""One Bedroom Suite"" avec un canapé lit dans le salon dont le matelas mériterait d'être changé. Si vous voulez faire un peu de cuisine, cela sera sommaire car il y a peu d'équipement en vaisselle (alors qu'il y a un supermarché à 300m dans State St.). Le petit déjeuner (inclus dans le prix) se prend au pas de charge (jusqu'à 9h) en semaine, et les ingrédients sont sans saveur. L'accueil est sympathique mais sans plus. Pour un séjour de 4 nuits, nous n'avons pas clairement fais un bon choix. Quelques points positifs: la piscine au dernier étage est une bonne idée; l'hôtel se trouve à mi chemin entre Hancock Tower au Nord et le Millenium Park au Sud dans le Loop; donc tout peut se découvrir à pieds. Le quartier de l'hôtel réserve par ailleurs de bonnes surprises de restaurants (Topolo, Iberico par exemple).",2

"I stayed in a private room with a shared bathroom for three nights. The room was quite small and didn't have any AC but you could open the window to let in air. The walls were quite thin - I heard the people next door, plus lots of people walking up and down the corridor at night. There was a fridge in the room but no coffee/tea maker - thankfully, Starbucks was just around the corner.
The bathroom and toilet were ok considering it was a shared facility. The toilet flooded on the last day I was there.
The central location was probably one of the main reasons I picked the hotel. I was able to walk around the city and didn't feel too unsafe at night when walking back to the hotel, despite the neighborhood.
I was able to borrow a hairdryer from the front desk and also print out my boarding pass.
If you have heavy luggage, it's quite a struggle to get to the front desk and your room as you have to walk up a flight of stairs.
There are lots of hotels in the area so I probably wouldn't stay here again.",2

"This hotel is now formally a Fairfield Inn and Suites, one of the Marriott brands. I have been an occasional business customer over the years and wouldn't hesitate to be a repeat customer. Yes, renovation continues, but what the critics don't mention is how much improvement in the property can be bought with 4.5 million dollars.
The makeover is impressive, and you're met with a lobby that has been completely renovated. It's bright, welcoming, and user friendly, with a business work area that includes computers, internet access, printing capacity, etc. Check in was responsive and fast, as was checkout. In the interim I experienced their breakfast offering, which was more than adequate. In addition to the requisite cereal, bagels, OJ, etc. they offer the capacity to make waffles and have a selection of Jimmy Dean Bacon or Sausage and Egg muffins that can be microwaved.
The rooms have been totally re-done and they are comfortable, roomy, and very nicely appointed. Mine came with a King sized bed, a comfortable easy chair and ottoman, a work desk and chair that were very comfortable and functional, the usual flat panel cabled TV, new carpeting, a small fridge and microwave, and all the other amenities that usually come with a room (coffee maker, hair dryer, etc.). Internet access was easy and the signal was strong.
My room overlooked the courtyard, and that was especially impressive. New french doors ensure a clear view of the courtyard but if you are so inclined you can open them, access a small balcony, and take in the sights and sounds below, to include the water fountain, palm trees, flowers and bushes, etc. The pool and sauna areas have been renovated as well, and are in the courtyard itself.
As regards my interaction with the staff and the manager of the hotel, I was impressed. They were always responsive, friendly and accommodating and certainly made me feel at home while away from home.
Lastly, and the real kicker, is their location, which is directly adjacent to Old Town. I would estimate a walk of no more than two or three blocks to get into Old Town. The property is just off I-5 but you won't notice noise from the highway. The entire property is ""gated"" so you should feel safe, with the surrounding area being upscale and very nice.
I would highly recommend this hotel to the business traveler, to families and to those who want a pleasant stay with very nice accommodating staff. It's location is ideal and the improvements to the property are impressive.",2

"We were so glad we chose to stay at the Westin for our weekend in N.Y.C. From check-in to check-out, the whole experience was wonderful. The staff was extremely friendly... we were able to switch to a 2-bed room at the last minute and were on one of the preferred floors with an incredible view of Times Square. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower (double shower heads) was great. The concierge was very helpful in directing us regarding transportation and activities. Overall, it was a great stay and we would definitely stay there again!",2
"Easily the best BBQ in Phoenix. They deserve every 5 star review. Brisket is good as the best in Texas. Ribs were excellent. Just everything about the place. I would give them $10 just to smell.\n\nMeat by the pound. One minor quibble. I like whole ring hot links. But the beans were spectacular. I was in BBQ coma land for the rest of the afternoon. Oh, get the pastrami on Thursdays. It's silly good.",2

"Reviewers seems quite divided on this property. My experience was largely positive, certainly considering my expectations after reading some of the reviews. I am a Hilton Gold, so I suspect that I got one of the better rooms. It was certainly comparable to big city Hiltons in other cities. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom fully functional. I didn't have much interaction with the hotel staff, but all interactions were positive. The fitness room was not too big, but not a problem at 8 in the evening.
I was advised at check in that construction would be going on between 9 and 5. I was only briefly in my room in this window. I would hear construction noise in the hallway, but not in my room.
I did eat the brunch on morning and was underwhelmed. There was an egg preparation station, which I probably should have used. Instead, I had some of the prepared dishes and they seemed a bit greasy. The service was attentive and friendly.",2

I have tears in both rotator cuffs and have a lot of pain. I thought this was just another gimmick but am willing to try practically anything for some relief. It came in the mail super fast. I took it out of the package and my first thought was ""What a pleasant smell"". No plastic. Not overpowering. Just a waft of lavender. It is super soft and the feel is excellent. I tried it straight out of the box - no heating, no cooling. Oh. My. God. Just the warmth of the material, the scent & the weight were enough to give me some relief. I can't wait to try it heated up if it feels this good right now. I will definitely be ordering several more for family members for gifts!",2

"It's a little pricey. Although, very comfortable and well run.
My daily rate was $299 (it really feels like a $199 - $225 hotel). And, I had to extend one night and they upped the rate to $399.
The one glitch was that there was a Bose clock radio in the room and it didn't work. The same thing happened for a business associate staying in another room.
All-in-all - I'd stay there again, but not at that rate.",2

I have only been to Vegas twice and though I have not been to a wide variety of clubs, I know what I like and agree with what everyone else has to say! Sad to say that they close off the pool area once fall hits and definitely hinders the experience. But since I came around spring break the cabanas were cracking and the pool was so pretty. I love how XS welcomes you to put your feet in and lounge around the pool. This was greatly appreciated after going to surrender last night, where they constantly yelled at you for even touching the water. \n\nXS blows every club out of the water and those who know anything about Vegas will come here. When the cabanas are not open, XS could definitely open up so more bars because it was super packed and hard to get drinks last time.",2

The hotel itself is gorgeous, the rooms are much bigger than we anticipated which was wonderful, but the service in this hotel far exceeds anything else. Everyone was so accommodating, any request was granted and with a smile--it was such a pleasure staying here. If you are able to get a room at this hotel I would not look any further you will not be disappointed! We also had dinner at The Island Creek Oyster Bar which was divine. Truly a great trip!",2

"If you're looking to stay in a beautiful, historic, convenient to the sights hotel, with the absolute best concierge (Guilliarme) in any hotel we've ever stayed anywhere in the US & Europe, book now while the weather is good, and kids are in school! The term ""lobbyist"" was coined there by Ulysses Grant, who liked to hang out there, as well as Abraham Lincoln. The bar is warm and friendly, with the famous patrons' portraits watch you ingest your wonderful drinks and appetizers. The rooms aren't the fanciest decor in the world, but the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in, in ages. The hotel restaurant, Cafe du Parc, has really good food, although it's seating is cramped and the service is really slow. Love this hotel!",2
"Just concluded another stay at the Stoneleigh and wanted to share some comments on this somewhat unknown jewel of a hotel. First, the service - each time I arrive the valets know me by name, have a smile and ask if they can help, this has never happened to me in any other hotel (as a result I've gotten to know them well) and is a great first impression for the Stoneleigh. I don't know if the staff has daily training on arriving guests or they just have a naturally great staff, but from the front desk to the concierge to bartender and Bolla waitstaff they provide great service with a smile and most seem to know me by name.
I eat breakfast there on occasion when time permits (Texas Benedict is truly unique and also wonderful), and asked for a slight change to the menu item one time, since that time, I've been asked without fail ""would you like the Texas Benedict as you ordered before?"". Again, this is unique in my experience and speaks to both the tenure and professionalism of the staff.
A quick review of the room itself:
They rooms are very nice with comfortable beds and great linens, and the soaring ceilings of a property built long ago. Although there are many different room configurations, and all the rooms I've stayed in are spacious with very good closet space and a super nice bathroom including great toiletries. The walls are thick and I've never been bothered by noise from a guest next door. As expected in hotel in this category there are nice flat screen TVs and reliable wi-fi. One of the most important qualities in a hotel is cleanliness and the Stoneleigh staff does a great job - my room is always sparkling and fresh. I could go on about all the other items that make for a great hotel - have never run out of hot water, plenty of water pressure in the shower, etc.
The hotel lobby and bar are uique and have great seating which is unusual and ecletic, but provides for good people watching. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.
The hotel has kept the qualities of its heritage while integrating technology, and providing great service. Stay here once and you'll be back!

"I'd heard about Spinato's for some time, but never found myself in the neighborhood to stop in and try it...until yesterday...WOW!! I can't comment on the dining-in service, but I definitely have something to say about the pizza! \n\nSome say it's hard to mess up a pizza, and other say pizza preferences are personal. What I loved about the pizza here was that the sauce was not too salty, not too sweet, and not too tomatoe-y/out of a can tasting. It was perfect! The cheese also quality and aplenty. I haaaaate when places skimp on the cheese. The toppings were great and also not sparse. The pizza didn't have an inch of grease on it and didn't have that soggy middle bottom like some places leave their pizzas. The crust was thin enough so that you didn't feel like you might as well have ordered a bread basket, but not so thin that you felt like you were eating off a cracker. \n\nAs Chicagoans, we had the Chicago pizza...fantastic!!! I can't wait to come back here again and try their other pizzas and calzones. So happy I was introduced to the greatness that is Spinato's!!",2
"i booked this hotel because it said it was pet friendly, put when i checked in they said they did not allow pet's. think goodness i had printed off the online info showing it being pet friendly.

"We stayed one night, too bad! Staff is friendly, not snotty or stuffy like some fancy hotels. They speak to you like they are your respectful friends - real people! The valet parking guys were a hoot and we had fun with them. Christina at the front desk was very helpful and nice. The room was very large, huge windows, great bathroom with a fantastic tub, great make-up mirror (designer) and very high ceilings. Liked the location much better than right on the water and not as ""snooty"" as that area where the Four Seasons is. The restaurant in the hotel has unique and inventive food - highly recommend it! Interesting history of the hotel. Highly recommend it, will stay here again!",2

"We stayed in a twin room that was tiny and in need of a facelift but for the price we paid it was more than adequete.
The location of the Milford Plaza is really excellent being one street away from Times Square so as a shopping base it is really ideal. We had issue with noisy neighbours on one night but it was dealt with straight away by security and we had no other issues.
We stayed on the 10th floor which has yet to be renovated but I really look forward to returning when it is completed.",2

"I'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem. Going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer, it's obvious that he's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I'd seen her previously in the Potter movies, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and loved her. In Driving Lessons, as she does lines from poetry and Shakespeare, I was awed by her timing, command of the language, and body language. I'm hoping it was make-up/costuming, as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis, though no mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse, I can say that she did this perfectly, portraying a woman on the brink of old-age, but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it in a theatre first-- but I doubt it ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque. We miss out on so many of these types of movies here.",2

"Wow. If you like music, you will LOVE the MIM. This place is amazing! Perhaps I should say if you like music OR architecture, you will love the MIM. This is the kind of place that as you walk through, you mutter to yourself, \""I can't believe I am in Phoenix!\"" The MIM now is affiliated with the Smithsonian Museums, and after touring the facility, you will agree that is a perfect partnership.\n\nI don't want to repeat what has already been said on the great reviews, so instead I will just reiterate that you really need at LEAST three hours to see the MIM. That three hours will mean you have not seen everything, but it's a start. The MIM has a really nice cafe with limited hours, but has a coffee shop which is open throughout the day. In addition, there is a gorgeous music venue which you can take a peek at while on your adventure. It looks like a perfect place to catch a show, and much like the rest of the MIM, it is eye candy.\n\nThe staff at MIM are very knowledgeable and super friendly. The audio system you wear while on your musical quest is really outstanding. The sound was superior, and makes Bose look like dollar store speakers. Lastly, don't miss the gift store, there are tons of great items there, and I found my Mom a little Mother's day gift. DO NOT MISS seeing John Lenin's piano which he played Imagine on. It will give you goosebumps!\n\n Hope you enjoy your visit.",2
"We've stayed here before and had a great experience so we came back for my 42nd birthday. We managed to secure an upgrade to a corner suite (not sure if that was because of our Starwood membership level or because it was my birthday but I was happy either way)!
The room was identical to the one we stayed at for my 40th. However, we had one major issue - the bathroom stank of smoke. Being non-smokers and with a 5 year old in tow, it was an issue. We called Front Desk and they arranged for a guy with a humidifier/atomiser type device run that in the bathroom for 30 mins while we had dinner in the restaurant. While eating dinner, the duty manager came over to apologise and gave us a $40 credit against breakfast which was very good service in my opinion.
The restaurant is very nice and the food was good as was the service.
On returning to our room, the smell in the bathroom was unfortunately still there but as it was late we left the issue till the morning.
The next day we decided we would have to change rooms as the smell was still bad and we were there for another 4 nights still. We called Front Desk and asked if we could change to an upgraded room or at least the same room type. They did not have an upgraded room for us (supposedly) but were happy to help us move to the same room type. My wife went to check out the room before we moved. She was happy with it so we packed all our suitcases once again and had someone pick them up to move them over.
The new room was similar to our old one but better as it seemed more spacious. And no smell!
We had great views and the room was very comfortable. So much so, my daughter rarely wanted to leave! We also had great fun playing on the table-top arcade game in the lobby which reminded me of my child-hood days!
My wife and I had a few drinks in the lobby bar too which was nice.
One warning, the bar does get noisy and busy in the evening so not quite as family-friendly at that point but still ok.
I used the onsite Bliss Spa for a facial while there (my birthday treat from the missus!) which was lovely. The only point I'd add is that the relaxation room where you wait before your treatment could use a few more amenities. The treatment itself, and the attendant carrying it out, were both great. Expensive but worth it!
We also used the Accura Experience a few times. This is a car service which you can book at the Accura desk near Concierge. They have a nice new, Accura that can take you anywhere within quite a large radius. You just have to watch an in-car video and fill out a survey on an iPad. The driver was very friendly. You just pay tips. Much better than a taxi! We didn't try getting them to pick us up and bring us back as that seemed a bit too cheeky!
They also arranged a delicious chocolate cake slice for my birthday which was really tasty!
Overall, a great visit, despite the issues. I'm sure we will be back again!",2
"It takes about 5 min walk to be at the center of Times Square and 3 min walk to the Central Park, which means you'll always have something to do. It's a huge hotel, like anything else in NYC. Staff is helpfull, and problems get fixed really quickly. Wi-fi is charged, but just across the street there's a Starbucks coffe with free wi-fi, you just have to wait a while to get a seat.
Room was good and warm. If you don't like heating systems you can open the window. The bathroom was not the cleanest, but you can take a good hot shower.",2

All I can say is that I'm glad I broke my buffet rule and gave India Oven a spin. This place was phenomenal!!! Hot food, great quality and stellar service...all three things I usually find buffet joints lacking in. The garlic naan was probably the best naan I've ever had. Go here.

Every aspect of my stay from check in to check out was handled with a smile and made me feel as if I was the most important guest on the property. However, I am certain that other guests received similar treatment. The pool and spa services were fantastic and as always the food was remarkable. And I cannot say enough about the staff- always helpful and always working hard to ensure a pleasant stay.",2
"Red Velvet Cupcakes....Ya'll for real dude! They have some Red Velvet cupcakes in this Walgreens, that is just as good as any cupcake place in town for about $1.95.

Matter of fact, they just call him now, when a new shipment comes in. And they will put some aside for him.",2

I am now on a mission to get that recipe!!! : )",2
"There are so few restaurants that deserve a 5-star rating, but Razz is undoubtedly one of them. While the exterior of the building appears nondescript, the interior is tastefully decorated and replete with artwork hanging on the walls. We always make a reservation to sit at the chef's table and everything we've ever had has been phenomenal. My husband and I have very diverse tastes and are willing to try just about anything, but I can honestly say that beef tongue is probably not something that we would ever have ventured to taste had it not been served to us here. It's now one of our favorite dishes, as is the \""macaroni and cheese\"" with lobster and crab meat. \n\nThe wine selection is great as well and we typically ask Razz to recommend a bottle and have never been disappointed. It's so clear that Razz is an incredibly talented chef who is doing what he loves to do! The restaurant does close over the summer so we will be eagerly awaiting its reopening in the fall to try some more of Razz's amazing creations.",2
"We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.",2
"For me a hotel room is just a place to sleep and shower, and I don't pay much attention to the details so this is my first hotel review. My room was inconveniently across the street from the office. The first thing I noticed was the bed offset from the base. I had to lift up my friend's bed so he could push in a metal bar in that was sticking out. All the lamps in the room were connected to the same wall switch. Wireless internet strength varied for me. My friend logged onto another open network. There was no remote for the TV. The radio/clock was broken and unable to be set. The bathroom light was on a timer with no fan. Even after crossing the street and speaking to the front desk, the phone had no dial tone. Hotel info said the place had been refurbished in 2008, since then dust bunnies had been multiplying behind the bathroom door under the peeling wallpaper.",2
"My wife and I just spent the weekend in Austin for a friends wedding and there were some horrible experiences for much of the wedding party during our time at the Driskill hotel.
One member of the wedding party was told he was being upgraded when he checked in, upgraded meaning he was given a room on a higher floor. What they didnt mention is that his air conditioning didnt work. When he attempted to move to another room he was told there werent any available for him, instead they said they could help him make a reservation somewhere else.
Another friend of ours got locked out of his room so they sent the maintenance guy up to help out, he attempted to use our friends key which obviously didnt work and then tried the master key which also didnt work. The maintenance guy said he would ""be right back""... 30 minutes later nobody had returned. Our friend then goes to the front desk again and a member of security went through the same steps, master didnt work nor did our friends key. Again the Driskill employee says ""be right back""... another 30 minutes pass and nobody returns. Our friend then checked out and got his bags the next day when they finally got access to his room. He was only given a 50% refund.
Last of all, after our shuttle ride from the ceremony back to the Driskill for the reception, I get off of the bus with a beer in hand. I met my wife at the bar and set my beer on the bar while I removed my coat, the bartender instantly came over and snagged my beer and told me no outside beverages. I then went upstairs to the reception and got a beer from the open bar and came back down to the bar with it and sat down next to my wife. He came over and said the same thing to me and tried to take my beer. I replied right after I moved the beer out of his reach, ""this isn't an outside beverage sir, I got it from the bar upstairs"", smiled and winked at him.
I must say that the hotel itself was beautiful, but the service was absolutely horrible not to mention the eye gauging prices! $25 for a fruit plate and OJ for breakfast!!!

"Booked a two day family mini-break around the labor day holiday. Loved the setting of hotel - just outside of San Antonio in the hill country. Sweeping vistas and quietness make you forget just how close to town you really are.
The hotel offers lots of activities ranging from golf and bicycle tours for adults to campfire smors and ping-pong for kids and young adults. And of course, one of the biggest attractions are the 3 water slides, lazy river, splash park and multiple pools that appeal to all ages.
The remoteness of the resorts means you will likely be eating several meals at the on-site restaurants. I found the service and quality of food were a bit uneven; great some times, and average at others. For a JW branded hotel, I would have expected both service and quality to have consistently delivered quality and service that are above average.
We did not take advantage of the on-site spa or golf course.
Overall, we had a terrific time. It was nice to have an resort with so many activities to choose from. The price for the room was a bit higher than I would have expected for the unevenness of the service and food quality that was delivered.",2
"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in MAY 2011 (late review I know!) and it was better than I expected. My husband is a diamond elitem rewards member so we stay with this chain alot, I booked this based on the pictures on the Best Western website. When we arrived we were prompty checked in and assigned a room in the newer building, it was clean and quiet. We were impressed with the location, right accross from the marina and water on either side. We were walking the grounds one night a saw a mamma duck sitting on her babies to keep them warm, super cute! Pool was clean and there is a nice fireplace to chat by the pool. Staff was helpful when needed. Wouldn't hesistate in staying here again!",2
"When in Montreal, take advantage of the presence of its many North African restaurants. The food was great! The meal ( lunch at least) came with an appetizer, a tagine, and some delightful baklava and mint tea for dessert. I ordered a chicken tagine that had olives and couscous mixed in. It was awesome. My friend ordered a vegetarian tagine which had peanut sauce and some veggies mixed in it. I tried a bit of her dish and it was delicious as well. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant,the decor is beautiful and the owner is very friendly.",2
"Stayed here for one night in July 2008. We booked on Priceline for $102/night. For the money, this was a very nice hotel. One complaint would be the $22/night valet or self parking fee. Since there is absolutely nothing around this resort, there is no options but to park your car here and pay the crazy rate. Internet is $13 a day but I think you can get free wireless around the pool. The pool area is nice. There are a couple jacuzzi's, a kid's pool and a big pool. There are cabana's to rent for 75/day weekdays or 120/day weekends for the whole day. Overall, the pool area was very nice. Looked at the beach, but its not a beach to lay around and relax but to do water activities or biking. Our rooms were on the 6th floor in the tower. We had a view of the bay as well as the 9:50pm fireworks show at Seaworld. Fireworks lasted around 5 minutes and that was a good fringe benefit of the room. The room came with 2 beds, desk, chair, refrigerator for your things and safe. The bathroom was clean and small but functional. Plenty of towels. We stayed in 2 rooms and one them was not available until 4:30pm. Check in time is 4:00. Check out time is 12 noon. Staff is very nice. If the price is right, I would stay here again.",2
"Five Stars
great product!! better than i expected",2
"Very convenient
I like it.. Very convenient",2
i recently stayed here and we booked through the bellagio-mgm-mirage site. got an awesome lake view room and you can see paris right in front of you its beautiful. room service is awesome the 2.5 lb steamed lobster was so good. the omlette was disappointingly dry! the garden next to the lobby was beautiful as usual and the themes always change so theres always something new to gasp your eyes upon each trip there.,2
i would rather give my business to someone i feel like i know and whose story i am sympathetic to,2
"After reading all of the reviews, I was skepitcal, but booked anyway. Was I glad I did! When we arrived, we were promptly greeted at the desk and checked in. We were given a room on the fourth floor with a king size bed of the main building.
I was amazed when we got to the room and saw how big it was. I was ready for a cramped hotel room with a bed, a tv, and maybe a desk to put a computer on. Surprised does not even begin to cover it. The room was LARGE with a king size bed and a sofa. There was a enough room to do excercises if you were so inclined. The room did face North Point and Columbus, which could get a a little loud at times, but if you spent all day out and about walking and enjoying the city, you were so tired when you got back that you didn't hardly notice it.
The bed was comfortable, the pillows were not. The bathroom was an average size hotel bathroom, which was all we needed. There was free wireless access in the rooms, which wasn't that fast, but it was adequate to surf the web and look at email. There was also computer access with printers on the 5th floor which we took advantage of at one point. There is also a computer in the lobby by the elevators to check in for your flight and print out boarding passes if you wanted to.
The staff was friendly and helpful. We did not eat the breakfast mainly because of the reports from everyone else on here. There was however, a very good place, Pergaminos, across the street that was absolutely wonderful fo breakfast.
At this hotel, you are 2 blocks from being on Fisherman's Wharf. Directly behind the hotel is a Hertz and Avis rental store if you want to rent a car. Also, you are two blocks from the cable car turn around, which was great. We were able to eat breakfast, walk to the cable cars, and ride them to Union Square in a very short amount of time. Also, you're only a couple of blocks from Ghiradelli Square, which has great ice cream if you are interested.
Overall, a very good hotel with great rooms and great service convenient to just about anything and everything you want to do.",2
"My BFF and I just found this place even though he has lived around the corner for 25 years. Food was fabulous. I had cheese burger and fries, he had a skillet breakfast with bisquits and gravy. Waitress was a sweety, helpful and attentive. Coffee wasn't the best tasting but was served generously. Prices are great too! Wish they had cocktails!",2
"I love these books. Yes, they can be a bit too pat at times, the characters pretty predictable, but still... delvers, shags, cliff behemoths, river rogues, hook hawks, and many many more - you have to give credit for creativity where it's due!! I've read my share of fantasy and never come across HALF the creatures in this series. I particularly enjoy the qualities of the delver!That is the ONLY reason I'm still reading them. The writing is just atrocious. Then is frequently used for Than. Most compound words are separated: he said so any way, she decided to cook some thing, they rose above ground, etc. It drives me insane. There's also a lot of redundancy; the author doesn't seem to have a very large vocabulary (or a thesaurus!!): he remains standing among the remaining guards still, etc. As you see, repeating the word AND re-stating the concept. If he remains there, obviously he's there still, so why add it to the end and make it awkward? Also, many sentences just don't make sense. Either they seem to be missing words, they seem to have extra words, or they seem unfinished.There are still other grammatical/spelling errors, but this is getting pretty long. As you can see, those things bother me a great deal. Imagine how interesting this world must be for me to continue reading! I'm currently on book 4, and I've marked 158 mistakes at the 23% mark but am still enjoying it!",2
"Travel Bags
I was on vacation for 3 weeks and I was able to fix all of my clothes in them",2
Never disappoints!,2
"I travelled to Seattle with my children (7 & 10) for a performance at the 5th Avenue theatre. I must admit that I booked through priceline and got a great price and from reading other reviews I expected service on par with what I paid. I did not get this at all. From the time we arrived (early check in at 1pm) we were served with a smile and exeptional attitude. When I acknowledged that we were early but hoped to be able to change before heading to a matinee performance at the theatre the lady at the front desk genuinely seemed happy to let us check in early. I asked if our room had 2 beds as per my email request and it did. The only mention of the fact that I had purchased the room through priceline was a mention that the room was already paid for.
Our room was on the 25th floor and afforded us a slight view of the water and a great view of the Westin (where my husband and I usually stay when we travel alone to Seattle). The room met our needs - it was clean and well appointed but not the luxurious feel of the Westin rooms we have stayed in.
The housekeeping supervisor knocked on our door and asked if she could check the caulking in the bathroom. She was quick to say she could certainly return if the time was not convenient. Her friendly attitude and offer of more towels when she noted that there were 3 of us in the room (it was already made up with towels for 3) and more coffee was just a signal as to why she occupied her management role.
While in Seattle we visited the Market a couple of times and the Sheraton's location is fantastic...when we are at the Westin it is a steep climb up a hill to return to the hotel but with the Sheraton it is such a gentle incline one barely notices they are walking uphill.
We ate in the hotel at the Daily Grill for supper and were pleasantly surprised. I had expected a more casual dining experience from the reviews I had read but my hazelnut crusted mahi mahi was prepared very well. The selection of wine was expansive and well priced for any budget. The children's meals were very much to the liking of my girls. The service we received was timely and friendly - noting that it was 7 when we entered the restaurant our waiter asked if we had any time constraints ( a nice touch for a family if they need to eat quickly or get to a theatre production or game).
We used the pool for a 1/2 hour on Saturday after dinner since it was occupied by older teenagers playing pass in the pool and young adults getting cozy in the hottub. Several other families arrived during that time frame.
On Sunday morning we got up and headed to the pool by 8:30; there were several families playing and others who were swimming laps. Warning:The hot tub was murky so we got out quite quickly.
From the valets to the reception desk to the restaurant staff and beyond the service made the Sheraton one of the shining stars of our weekend. Thanks for a great stay!!",2

"My husband and I spent 2 nights at the W over President's weekend for our anniversary. I had read the reviews, but we got a very attractive rate, and figured the issues had just been isolated. Unfortunately, many of the negative comments I had read were right on the money... Room design is poor... it's a small room with nowhere for 2 people to comfortably lounge, other than the on the bed. We wanted to hang out in the room and watch the olympics while having a drink, but it wasn't at all conducive. Walls are horribly thin - we were awoken both nights by noisy people in rooms around us. Guy singing in the shower next door at 6:30 a.m. sounded like he was in our room. The open window between the bath and bed was just weird... We weren't horribly undone by it, but I can see how it could be a huge issue for people who practice discretion. Housekeeping was not efficient - one day the cleaner left her Monster energy drink in our room, and another she failed to change out dirty wine glasses. A tray of leftover room service food sat in our hallway for at least 20 hours... Valet service was not efficient either - we tried to call ahead and have our car brought up, but were refused and told we had to come down with our ticket before they would retrieve it. I would only stay again if rate was $150/night or less.",2
My most favorite New Mexican place. I love the chips and dips and the large dinner portions. The taco are awesome. I also love the free desert. Great.,2
"I was slightly worried I'd left ordering a new phone for the teenager's Christmas present too late with all the strikes. However, I shouldn't have worried. Phone was easy to order and came up on Uswitch as the best deal. It arrived 24 hours after ordering with regular updates letting me know it was on its way. Great service, easy to order and I'd definitely recommend.",2

This is the BEST flask I've ever order. I've order so many before from other suppliers. I use them for my handmade gift shop and they're perfect.

"With its rerelease by ADV Films, I've had a chance to watch ""The Giant Majin"" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!The sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant Majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!",2

"My first time at Serrano and I am very impressed with the location. Let it be business or tourism, staying at this hotel will put you bang in the center of downtown. Very close to Powell BART station (0.5 miles) and about 0.4 miles to get a ride on the world famous cable car. Westfield mall is 0.5 miles too. The intersection of Powell and Market Street where all the shopping is, is only 0.5 miles.
Close to market street means it is a bit far to the touristy locations of Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, Pier 39, Embarcadero road etc. All the destinations are around 2 miles from the hotel.
Regarding food, never had in Serrano's restaurant but there are plenty of restaurants catering to all variety of people around Serrano. You will get almost all the cuisines around Serrano. That is not a problem at all.
Regarding the staff, they are OK. They could do a better job, be more friendly. That doesn't mean they have done a bad job, they are there for whatever you want, but they could be a bit more friendly.
The rooms are medium sized with flat screen televisions. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is adequate. If you have 3 to 4 big suitcases, it might be a bit cramped but majority of the rooms in San Francisco are of this size.
One thing I was really disappointed about this place is Wifi. It is complimentary but sucks big time. It is slow by US standards and is very inconsistent, by far the worst internet experience I have had in all the hotels I stayed. Terrible, without this problem I would have rated the hotel 4/5.",2

"wow. I am so glad that one opened up in Anaheim because I usually trek all the way to Vegas for this hot deliciousness wrapped up in 2 pieces of bread. I highly reccomend the Holiday turkey. It has stuffing, cranberry sauce, turkey and gravy allll in one sandwich. Taste bud explosion. The tuna is amazing !! Cold tuna, spread on 2 puffy pieces of bread and cheese melted to perfection. Spicy Italian, just like that all warm spicy meats sandwiched between 2 toasty buns !! I also have 1/2 a salad the Cobb is perfect. Cranberries, chunks of chicken, nuts, onions and ranch tossed in between crisp salad leaves. I love it here !",2

"Amazing vegan sushi, edamame, wakame and miso soup! The service was great throughout our meal helping us to decide on which dish’s to order and the restaurant is really clean and very atmospheric!

"What a hidden gem. Always loved the outdoor taco stand while shopping in the strip...but go downstairs and a surprise awaits. The decor is genuine and interesting. A variety of very comfortable, quality seating choices (high tops, long communal-like tables and traditional seating) peek into windows where tortillas are being made on an old-school conveyor. \n\nFood is authentic and fresh, high quality ingredients. We have tried all the meats now and each was seasoned very tastily and expertly! A full bar lines one wall... so I imagine its lively on weekends!\n\nFrom a California transplant, this is the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh.",2
"We just stayed at this hotel from March 11th to March 14th 2012. The hotel is in a fantastic location and we were greeted with smiles from the cute bell boys. The decor is very cool and still feels warm, especially the restaurant at the entrance. The lobby is on the second floor which is inconvenient. The staff at the front desk were nice but didn't explain anything about the services offered or the Ipad that comes with the room (which was great) but we had to call and ask a million questions that should have been answered before they were asked. The room was small, king bed on the 23rd floor but the bright light and amazing views made up for it. The bed was really comfortable and I would stay there again.... but not eat there... the room service for 2 burgers and water was $77.",2

"Down a lane way we made our way to the restaurant. Tried the fried wontons for starters which were nice. Our host was friendly, informative of the island, the accommodation available, the history of the restaurant as well as attending to meals and cocktail types. It made for a relax full, friendly evening.The mains we bought were the Laksa (which was a huge bowl) as well as beef rendang and a chicken dish I can’t recall the name of, but all got the thumbs up.Might just go back for the gin varieties!",2
"You know you have arrived as a VIP when you step into the Paiza club. You need a one million dollar credit line, to play here. I had the opportunity to stay in the paiza suites for one weeks time. 3 bedroom suites, Karaoke room, excercise rooms. Bottles of Louis XIII in the room ready for me to drink. My week consisted of Gambling everyday, clubbing everyday, messages everyday. 24 hour butler service. Shark Fin soup every morning when i woke up along with the Chinese delicacy birds nest soup. \n\nYou probably can't stay here betting 500 a hand, your looking more at $5000 a hand for 8 hours a day of baccarat. Can't go wrong when your playing with that type of Moolah. \n\nLove the food, love the casino.",2

"I've stayed at the Park Central in the past (although I couldn't find my review).... and I had recommended it to everyone that I knew was going to New York. I wasn't as impressed this time. We stayed for one night, Sunday in early May.
We waited quite a while in the checkin line and there were two desk agents standing at the front desk that weren't helping guests - I don't mind a line, but I do not like waiting when others are standing by idle, they shouldn't be in customer's view. The rate we were offered included a restaurant and attractions discount card, but it wasn't provided upon checkin and I didn't remember it until we were already out on the town. Checking out was efficient.
When we asked Bell Staff about taking the train to Newark, they really discouraged it and instead promoted the town car or taxi. It's about a $6 fare to Penn Station and the train was actually very convenient, even with all our luggage.
The room itself was clean but it looked a bit tired, the wallpaper was bubbling in the corner. Not a showstopper. But, the in room safe was locked. I called down to have it unlocked and we waited around for an hour then finally left with all our valuables in tow. We returned 6 hours later to find the safe still locked. The desk agent apologized for the inconvenience when we checked out. Internet worked great, allowed 3 devices for the 24 hour charge.
We ate in the restaurant.... they had a great 3 course lunch special. Very reasonably priced. Unfortunately the lounge wasn't open when we were there (Sunday??), otherwise we would have enjoyed a drink there.
I managed to re-book the room closer to our stay and get a much cheaper rate (about $135)! I would have been disappointed if I had paid more for the room given the quality of accommodations/service.",2
"I called Vladimir after finding him on Yelp for a washing machine issue. The clutch was going out on it. Vladimir called me back with the price of the part, $375. I told him to get it and come on out. He made an appointment with me, was on time, looked at my washer, prepared to install the new part, and then saw that my motor was leaking grease from the bearings onto the clutch housing. He told me that it was an expensive fix, and that if he installed the new part, it would only last a few months and then I would be back where I started. I had him put it back together without the new part, and while he was there, he also looked at my dishwasher, and told me how to fix it myself for cheap, and told me my under the counter wine cooler would be very expensive to fix, and that I would be better off buying a new wine cooler while I was buying the new washer. He was honest, could have installed the part and charged me $500, but instead he charged me the service call and a small fee for lubricating the clutch while he had it out. We were very impressed with Vladimir after some of the \""professionals\"" we have dealt with over the past several years. He's now on our speed-dial as our appliance repair guy.",2
"Spicy indian food, lil high priced. RM 25 for a biryani..",2
"Our emergency trip to DC had us choosing any hotel that was near our son's home and Washington Hospital Center. Because they indicated parking we chose this hotel. Beware, if you drive, parking may not be available on weekends. We had to park at a different hotel and pay $40 plus walk back 30 minutes. If we had known this we would have not gotten a vehicle. But with our visits to the hospital we thought it would be more convenient with our own transportation. We ended up leaving the car at the hospital and using taxi service. The staff were very accommodating, we ordered from their room service close to closing, but the food was excellent. We had a corner suite with pull out sofa, also kitchen that had stove top, microwave and a few dishes. I would stay here again, just not with a vehicle.",2
"Great stay! Rooms were large. I had already been in the city for 5 days on business staying at the Hilton @ 53rd & 6th. My husband was joining me for a few days of personal stay & the Hilton would not give us a reasonable rate, so I found this hotel thru Priceline...and moved...rolling my suitcase 4 blocks. Comfortable beds, quite, easy to sleep. Very convenient...anytime of day!
When leaving for the airport, a cab driver gave me a price that he made sound like he was giving me a bargain. When I told one of the bellmen he told me the driver was ripping me off. He flagged us another cab.",2
"We booked this hotel over the Labor Day weekend (Saturday to Monday). I decided to try Washington Plaza based on the price and the reviews on tripadvisor. We were definitely not disappointed. The hotel has recently been updated so the decor is very modern with a large outdoor pool with plenty of lounge chairs, pool bar and outside dining. It also has a restaurant and lounge area. We visited both and were pleased with the food and drinks. The bartenders were great! The hotel also has conference facilities. Our room was on the 4th floor and overlooked the pool and Thomas Circle. The staff was very accommodating. The hotel offers self park as well as valet parking. We used valet parking which was $29 per night. I'm not sure what the self park price would've been. Rooms were very modern and clean with a nice sized bathroom. The McPherson Square metro stop was a 10 minute walk. There is also a 24 hour CVS across the street from the hotel which is very convenient. The White House was a 15 minute walk. Overall I would definitely recommend Washington Plaza. We plan on returning here on our next trip to DC.",2

"Having read some of the mixed reviews on this hotel I was ready to ask for a new room even before I entered the building. When I went to reception the staff were friendly, quick and full of helpful information. The inside of the hotel was is a bit dated but I think it adds to the character. The rooms are not as small as I thought. We choose a non-smoking room and it was in good condition and very clean. The bathroom is small but adequate and again very clean. The location of the hotel is the main second to none. You walk out the front door and you are on Time Square. We went to the Lunt Fontane Theatre which is next door to the hotel and had a great experience of our first Broadway show. The hotel is very keenly priced for the location and I would suggest that this hotel is perfect for anyone who wants a central base in a clean and friendly environment.",2
I stayed at The Arizona Grand Resort Feb. 22-26. It is a quick 15 min trip from the PHX Airport. The property is beautiful with fabulous fountains and lush greens. The staff was top notch. Everyone was on their game. We had a great check in experience with Tim. The valets helped us figure out how to get the top down on our convertible. Our room overlooked the private waterpark for hotel guests. I was really impressed with the guards and staff in the water park. It had just opened for the season and everyone working there seemed like they knew what they were doing. It was very clean and seemed very safe. My kids had an unbelievable adventure. The restaurant at the hotel served a great buffet. The beds were great. The housekeepers did a great job. I really enjoyed myself and would highly recommend this hotel. It was a perfectly lovely getaway!,2
very good result,2
"Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's `Rope', then you will like this movie. `Murder by Numbers' stars Sandra Bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. The teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. The movie reminds me of various `Hitchcock' movies crossed with the TV show `Law and Order'. We see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.The other plot in the movie relates to Cassie Mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but I found this to the most intriguing part of the story.`Murder by Numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and suspense, try `Se7en' or Hitchcock's `Dial M for Murder'.",2

It has never been crowded when I am there, which is fine by me. I am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review, in fear of it becoming popular, because I like this little gem that Christina P. introduced me to just the way it is!",2

The interior / exterior is very very nice , outdoor patio with fire pit . The interior also has an transparent fireplace, connected to a very comfy looking library / lounge , a well stocked coffee station , another lounge , and bar with 60\"" TV .

If you are making a dish that needs to be stirred, do it with ease or you will tear the liner thus defeating the reason for having one.

"We stayed here for 1 night between Christmas and New Year's in 2007. We were celebrating our anniversary, and I wanted to stay and eat on the Riverwalk for one night. I'm a native Texan and have been to San Antonio and the Riverwalk many times -- but I had never seen it lighted up for Christmas. I was truly beautiful. The hotel was very clean; we had a room overlooking the river (on about the 10th floor). It is not in the middle of all of the activity on the riverwalk, but certainly within about a 10 minute walk to it. We stayed there on a Thursday night -- and of couse it being the holidays, it was crowded -- but we did not feel nervous about walking back to the hotel late at night.
The Alamo Bowl was going on that weekend, so there were a lot of young college students there early. The Riverwalk was very crowded, but with our hotel being slightly away from it all, we did not hear any of the revelry that was going on late at night.
It was worth the trip, and we will definitely stay here again.",2

"I've loved mysteries, ever since starting out as a girl with Nancy Drew. I eventually moved on to Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Dorothy L. Sayers. I also love to read historical romance, especially Regency and Victorian.So how could I help loving the Lady Julia Grey books? Simple. I couldn't. The three books in this very nicely priced ebook bundle were much more mystery than romance, but that's okay. They were engaging and well constructed. The underlying romance -- which in these three books take Julia and Brisbane from first meeting to marriage -- is subtle but gripping. Brisbane is such a delicious, deeply layered character.",2
"As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings quite good, and a HUGE step above previous attempts at animating everyone's favorite Gaul.For someone not familiar with the famous comic series, the show would be hard to follow, but for those of us in the know, it's a pleasure to watch.First and foremost, the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations. You can tell they took the time and effort to really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around.As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie and I can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down, but I was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen, any qualms I had were minor by comparison. Minor spoilers follow...Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief, who has been captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that by the boy teaching them about fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid. In the process, the boy meets the Viking Chief's daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc etc etc... If my explanation sounds convoluted, don't worry.. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a great buy.. You can purchase this DVD through Amazon France, but be warned.. Your DVD player probably won't be able to play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to view it..",2
"I love this place. Great spot for some basic food, yummy drinks. Service isn't always super fast but it's not a place for fast. Great spot to go with a friend and chill during the week. I highly recommends the hummus and fig salad.",2
"Excellent food! I'm not a particular fan of Indian food but I must say that this is definitely the best I've ever tasted. Me and my fiancee came here for V-Day after hearing it was one of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas. The location (Sahara and Commercial Center) is a bit of a grungy area but we go there to eat at Komol's quite often so the less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too much. The interior is dimly lit and pretty cozy as well. We got seated right away and had our orders taken within the next 10 minutes. We had a vegetable (carrot, onion, and parsley) ensemble for our starter dishes which was quite spicy but very tasty. I also had the vegetarian stir fry which was brought out on a steaming hot plate and smelled just as good as it tasted! This dish had a typical stir fry 'onion-y' taste and came complete with cauliflower, red and green peppers, grilled tofu, and more parsley. My main dish was a vegetarian curry and it was awesome! I also had garlic naan and kashmiri naan which was also killer! The kashmiri naan was naan with a cherry-like filling and it wasn't too sweet, complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely. I also had the rice pudding for dessert and it was standard like other rice puddings I've had before. Food aside, the service was pretty good. They were a bit slow in bringing our food out and that was a bit irritating. We were there for almost 2 hours and we are definitely not slow eaters! They got my order wrong three times during our visit. The wine was the wrong one and decided to let that one slide but they brought out the wrong appetizer and wrong curry. Still not sure how that happened, but I let them know I got the wrong dishes and they gladly replaced them with the right ones and pretty quickly, at that. They also added a 10% percent discount on our bill and gave us extra naan. Now that's service! We didn't ask for the discount or naan so that was a real pleasant surprise. They had a Valentine's special going so 4 dishes and a dessert with a glass of wine came out to be $40 a person which was actually pretty good considering the regular prices of the plates which averaged around $12 dollars each. Overall, the service was a little slow but good and the food was awesome. Definitely coming back to experience Namaste again in the future.",2

Everything is real good on insta but recently I noticed that people are allowed to take screenshot of pictures we share for view once or which has time limits. What's the point of time limit or view once if that person is getting to have screenshot? I'm sharing a photo but I don't want the other person to have it in their phone and so I choose view once option but what's the point if the other person is able to save it in their phone though screenshots. Please fix it or update it 🙏🏻,2

"I took my man here last night for him to experience the lovely experience which I always indulge in, fortunately, he loves it... mind blowing for him I would say.I always enjoy my experience here in Chynna Hilton due to their wonderful service & amazing food. If not mistaken, they won the Michelin awards, and I would say they deserve it. I am rather a fussy person, when it comes to tea and serving, I would like to give my compliments and utmost gratitude to Aida + tea Sifu from Chynna. Aida understands my preference when it comes to tea, so does the tea master. They made my personalised Ba Bao Cha amazingly great. Due to that, Chynna is my go to place when I want to enjoy great tea to relief work tension.In addition to these 2, special compliments to the Indian lady + Chinese young lady - Lily, who are equally helpful and always ensuring my tea cups are full, my empty plates were changed. All of them literally ensure high quality services as service crew. You really feel welcomed and well taken care of.Now, when it comes to food, my favourite here is my Pamelo chicken. Awesomely great !!! And it’s a must try. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy in the inside, topped with pamelo and sweet sauce. So you get the sweet and sour. The mixed vegetables + dragon veggie + yang Zhou fried rice are awesome too. The veggie’s are well cooked, with a crisp ...Anyway, I pledge my loyalty here. Took many people here and they love it. It’s worthwhile to pay a visit for ;)",2
"Viajé a Nueva York con mi pareja a principios de enero y escogimos este hotel por las opiniones que vimos de los usuarios. No pudimos hacerlo mejor. Hotel nuevo, bastante céntrico (8 min de Times Square) y sobre todo, insonorizado. Me habían comentado la incomodidad de dormir en Nueva York por los ruídos pero en las cabinas ni te enteras, el silencio es total. Aunque las habitaciones no sean muy grandes tampoco pasas demasiado tiempo en ellas, hay mucho que ver en la ciudad!! El desayuno a base de muffins se llega a hacer algo repetitivo pero cada planta del hotel cuenta con una sala con microondas, café, té y posibilidad de que calientes allí tu comida. Sin duda, una gran elección que no dudaré en repetir si vuelvo a la Gran Manzana.",2

"NO HEATING - aparently they only put the heating on when it reaches 45F. We had to sit in blankets in the room!
DARK DINGY CORRIDORS - yes they maybe trendy for under 25's. If you are over 40 or have kids, DONT STAY HERE.
Corridors look like a prison.
ROOMS - PRISON CELL SIZE. I HAVE BEEN TO YOUTH HOSTELS THAT ARE WARMER AND LARGER.
NO CURTAINS - so you cant keep the cold out.
NO TEA/COFFEE.
IT'S A CONVERTED GOVERNMENT APARTMENT BUILDING AND IT SHOWS (THATS WHY THEY CANT PUT THE HEATING ON)
We checked out after one day. It was that bad. Book the Park Central around the corner. It is wamer, larger and cheaper.
All you are paying for at the Hudson is some 'trendy' paint and gloomy 'hip' lighting.
We also stayed in the Club Quarters at the Rockfeller centre. It was pure luxary compared to this dump, I am 45 and went with one child. I cant even begin to think what would have happened if my mother or anyone with poor eyesight booked this hotel, They probably would have fallen over or into something.",2
"I was very impressed with how quickly someone responded to me on Twitter, and then for the advice they gave.",2
"There are great reviews on the location, service and value of this hotel already which I wholeheartedly agree with and will not repeat. One thing that really impressed me was the standby upgrade offers Yotel emails you a few days prior to check-in. I opted in for the cheapest upgrade at $14 a night to a corner view room. However when we arrived, there were no corner view rooms available. The check-in staff kindly upgraded us to a larger room but still only charging us the lower rate. The other thing that was a highlight for me was the free real coffee that was available - a great way to wake up to a day of sight seeing in the city.",2

"Firstly, the staff are excellent - will assist you with whatever you need. We stayed for a weekend in a Penthouse Suite for about $350/night - a terrific value and a good size room for Manhatten and balcony was HUGE! Would I pay the regular rate of $850 for this room? Not a chance, but at $350 the room is a terrific value for what you get. The room is a little worn - the walls a little banged up and the ceiling tiles quite run down, but otherwise fabulous. The bathroom was great and the bath products very high end. The bed was very, very comfortable. The upper east side location is terrific - our first time out of time square and well worth it. My husband, who is very picky, said this is our new base when in NYC - a true compliment. You should know that there is no room service, but the attached restaurant, Serafina, is wonderful. Bottom line - if you can get a deal, the hotel is very worth it.",2
"After so many positive reviews of this hotel there's not much left to say. With that said, here's my 2 cents worth. The Homewood Suites is very comfortable within walking distance to attractions and restaurants. There's a friendly, helpful front desk staff. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and is kept well stocked. If your stay is on a weekday the hotel offers a dinner buffet and complimentary wine and beer. Clean, comfortable rooms and very affordable rates for D.C. I'd stay here again in a minute.",2

"I recently returned from a three-day / two-night business trip to Bahsten. In all of my years of travel I have actually spent little time in this city. I more or less threw a dart at a dartboard on hotels.com and picked . . . this Club Quarters Boston (henceforth referred to as 'CQB'). As I always do, my review is broken down into the Great, Good, Bad, and Ugly. Ready? Here goes . . .
GREAT
* Location: for a business trip where one hopes to work in a little sight-seeing, just TRY to top this location. This hotel is a five minute stroll from the blue line (that takes you there from the airport) near the old state house and even closer to the bus line the other way (Otis & Summer) that will take you back & forth to the convention center. After work, many of the town's central historical districts and sites are a quick walk: the old state house (great museum), site of tea party, Freedom Trail, Union Oyster House & Bell in Hand Tavern, Faneuil Hall, Little Italy, etc., etc. I chose the CQB for location and it was better than expected.
* H20: It is a small gesture by the CQB for their guests but . . . wow, did I appreciate it. Instead of using bottled water to try to gouge their guests like 99% of the business class hotels I have frequented, the CQB provides bottles and purified water in neat in-wall units in the hallways for the taking. Boston is a very 'walkable' city and having bottled water is a must. I very much appreciated this.
GOOD
* Temperature: it's an issue in July and I found the room's temperature controls to be fantastic. One merely sets the desired temperature and the system does the rest - no constant adjusting and re-adjusting. When on, the system ran quietly - nice.
* Elephant & Castle: I didn't get to stop in for dinner but it's a big plus having this E & C pub (named for the famous London tube stop) adjoining the CQB as - in the IMMEDIATE area - your nighttime dining & drinking options will be otherwise limited.
* Service: the CQB has an automatic check-in that the front desk person was good enough to run me through and I found their staff (in limited interactions) to be pleasant.
BAD
* Yes, the rooms are small. It felt like staying in Europe - not that this is a particularly bad thing - and I do think the rooms make the most of their size. I had no problems but I was alone. Stay with a roommate or two and you'll feel it.
UGLY
* Wrapper: on one hand, I think there is real emphasis on cleanliness at this hotel but . . . . I did find a energy bar wrapper on the floor from a previous guest just under the edge of the bed. I'll live, and the hotel does appear to be very clean overall.
BOTTOM Line Comments:
* Come with accurately calibrated expectations (applies anywhere, really) and you will not be displeased with the CQB.
* While in town, take some time to re-acquaint yourself with our nation's founders and their epic story of striving for self-guidance and limited government. I suggest the excellent museum at the old state house.Their lessons need to be remembered more than ever today.
* Should I get to come to this nice city on business again, I will return to the CQB.

"I spent one night at the Copley Square Hotel in Boston, I found it very nice and the staff accommodating. There is also a large Shaw’s grocery store across the street, which is convenient in case you left anything at home or did not want to eat out.
I was in a king room, while it was small it was well appointed and comfortable. The bathroom in my room was large and adequate. My brother was at the hotel as well and although he reserved a double room they checked him into a huge 2 bedroom family suite. The bedrooms were very large although they shared a bathroom which was small.
Make sure you are not above the bar f you are staying on the 2nd floor, as the bar gets very busy and those rooms can be noisy.",2

"Our first ever trip to NYC so we wanted to be sure of a good hotel. On checking Tripadvisor, the reviews pointed us to the Hotel Giraffe - and as usual with Tripadvisor, we were not dissappointed!
The Hotel was exactly what we required - small, friendly and ideally placed to visit the city, with a subway stop just yards away. The rooms were well appointed, with comfortable beds and excellent service. There was very little traffic noise, despite being on a cross-roads in Manhattan! Our room had a small but usable balcony from which to gaze at the busy street life below.
Breakfast was a combination of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, bagels and all the coffee you could need! The evening reception between 5 & 7 served free wines by the glass and a selection of cheeses and other nibbles - an ideal way to end a busy day - or start the evening!
We would certainly stay here again - friendly staff, a great location and a wondeful room certainly made for a very memorable holiday!",2
"We and the wife went there place is beautiful food was great, drinks were amazing, music was good, after dinner we saw the 8 pm show which was nice but a bit too long.

I ate at the bar a few times and that was good for bar food. The room was kind of small but that was the only downfall. The bed was comfortable, no noise from other rooms. The bathroom was fairly large with a walk in shower. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back. I stayed for a week on business and had no complaints.",2
"Don't mistake ""War Inc."" for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs. It isn't.This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy, with ridiculously coincidental plot twists, stock characters (given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a straightforward approach to the political content.You see, the filmmakers' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true. Yeah, we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons, and American imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now -- but none of that is the point.Here, all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon -- sometimes in genius ways -- as the backdrop for a silly romp, as John Cusack's character (the hit-man with a heart) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him (Tomei) and the young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss.That's all, and it works. It's simple fun, but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the Middle East wish our Western culture would supplant theirs, then you might not find it as funny.For all the rest of us, it was a light comedy with a political edge.",2
"We stayed for 4 nights at the end of the Summer and needed a hotel in a good location so we could see all the sights. This hotel was absolutely perfect for us; great central location and walking distance from most things. The hotel was very clean and tidy and the rooms were ridiculously big for a Manhattan hotel! The kitchen was brilliant as we always had leftovers after every meal so could store them in the fridge and heat them up the next day. We only ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel on the last night but I wish we had discovered it earlier! Massive amounts of food for a good price. Overall it was a great hotel, with great rooms and all for a very very reasonable price. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone going to New York.",2
"The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy's the man. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.

"i love this place so much for the down home new york city corner look of it. it seriously looks like they picked this place up from manhattan and delivered it to phoenix.\n\nyes, it's small and a little cramped inside. get it to go and let me gawk at all the amazing products lined up across their shelves. so many rare types of strange delicacies i can't believe it. lutefisk! i haven't tried it but i'm going to give it a go next time i'm in there.\n\nalthough the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food, you can't really deny the cheesiness (oh puns) of this place. they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard. the bread was so soft it nearly melted in my mouth and the corned beef was top notch and not extremely fatty. it was a perfect size as well, not too big and meaty but not too scrawny. packed a lotta punch. they use boars head meats, and you can't really go wrong there.\n\nprices are very reasonable too, you can get out of their unscathed for a mere ten bucks. it's community seating inside so be prepared to go cozy.",2

"The only reason I stayed at this hotel as opposed to a less expensive hotel in NYC is because Holiday Inn's Priority Club rewards program is total BS when they say you can use your rewards night points anytime, anywhere. I tried to book every single Holiday Inn brand hotel in NYC during the Christmas shopping season and they told me I couldn't use my rewards points for a free night at any of them because the Christmas season was called a 'special event' and 'special event nights' at hotels can be blocked from people using their rewards nights at a hotel. This was even though the hotels had availability for guests who wanted to pay for the room. When I explained that 'no blackout dates' in their marketing should mean just what it said ... they explained that I wasn't being shut out of a hotel because it was a 'blackout' ... I was being shut out because it was a 'special event'. The 'special event just happened to last every weekend for 2 months. Which is basically the same thing, in my opinion. If a hotel has vacancies that you are not allowed to book using a reward night because a paying guest might want to book the room, that is a black out night.
Anyways ... after Priority Club refused to bend on this policy, they asked me if I would like to book a room and pay for it since they would not allow me to use points for the entire month of December. I ended up getting a 'special rate' of $275 for the Crown Plaza because I complained so much. The normal rate was around $450 per night, which is absolute highway robbery. I realize it is Manhatten during the holidays, but still ...
I'd get a room with a dinner in the restaurant at the Ritz in Boston during the holiday season for what this hotel charges for a single night. The lobby is huge and crowded with people. You cannot even walk through the lobby without moving between groups of people. Check in took almost a half hour. There were about 8 - 10 check in stations and about 3-4 people actually doing check in.
The valet parking was expectedly overpriced for a hotel in this area. I'd say a night's valet charges for a car were about $20 more expensive than some of the non-name brand hotels, like the Wellington. In fact, you would be able to get a hotel in Connecticut and take the train into the city for around the same price of ONLY THE VALET COST for a two night stay at the Crown Plaza in Manhatten.
WARNING ... The self park process is VERY confusing at this hotel. I decided to self park the car in the hotel's garage and asked the doorman where the parking garage was. He told me I'd have to go up 3 or 4 streets and make a U-Turn. When I did, I pulled into the parking garage that it seemed he told me about. I asked the attendent if this was the Crown Plaza parking and he said 'Yes. People from the Crown Plaza park here.' When I checked out, I found out that even though this was the closest lot to the hotel and seemed to be the place the doorman had given me directions to, this was not in fact the Crown Plaza's lot. They tried to charge me almost $200 for 2 nights worth of parking. The Crown's lot was one street over. Luckily, it turns out the hotel workers have a special rate set up for that garage since it is closer to the hotel than the actual Crown Plaza parking garage and the hotel manager was actually able to call over and tell them to give me the worker's rate, which was $25 per night, so it worked out ... but cost me about an hour's worth of time.
The actual hotel is very big. There is a mix of business travelers and tourists at the hotel. The lobby is very big and has a few seating areas. It is usually very crowded. Elevators are a bit slow because there are so many floors and so many people staying there.
The rooms are small ... which for Manhatten is understandable (even at $450 per night.) The decorations in the room were fairly neutral. I seem to remember a lot of yellow and off-white. It didn't really feel great compared to the decor of some of the other hotels. However, unlike a few of the comparable hotels (Sheraton, Marriott, etc.) this is not located right in Times Square, although it is a very short walk to Times Square and a fairly easy walk to Rockafeller Center and Fifth Avenue if you know where you are going. The location is pretty central to the touristy stuff ... if you are planning on doing some of the trendy areas such as Soho or the East Village ... plan on a pretty long cab ride. This hotel is probably more for tourists who want to see Times Square and Broadway.
I will agree that the hot water situation is pretty annoying. There are times where you wake up in the morning and will have to take a lukewarm shower because there are so many other floors. The view from the room wasn't great ... it was another very tall building and a crane. I am not sure that any room has a good view as it is kind of in the middle of a few tall buildings.
The service is bad ... maybe because it is so crowded. I will agree that most of the people who are working there seem snooty. The front desk person was fairly matter of fact and I didn't feel like anyone went out of their way to welcome me. It almost seemed like I was an annoyance as a guest and there were a few times I had to ask for things several times before anybody did anything about it. The maids were very friendly and most times said hello or greeted us when we saw them in the hallway.
I probably wouldn't stay here again. For the price that the room normally cost, it is not worth it. I would rather stay at the Sheraton or Marriott which are right in Times Square and would probably be easier to find with a car ... and the staff probably isn't as rude.
On a side note, since my experience with the bogus black out dates ... and having to pay $250 for a room I should have been able to use Priority Club Reward points to get when there was vacancy in the hotel for potential paying customers ... I have cut down on my Holiday Inn stays substantially. I now split my stays between Holiday Inn and Sheraton for business and personal travel because Sheraton doesn't have as many shady exclusions for their free nights, even if it is harder to earn points with Sheraton.",2
"Das ""ALEX"", das mir seit einigen Jahren vertraut ist, zeigt allmählich Verbrauchsspuren. Von seinem ursprünglichen Designercharakter hat es sich inzwischen ein ganzes Stück entfernt.

I don't have nothing to say,2
"The great James Cagney, top-billed in big letters, doesn't show up till the movie's second third, and probably has less screen time than Dudley Digges, who plays the eee-vill reform-school potentate. But when Jimmy arrives, as a deputy commissioner of something-or-other out to reform reform schools, he slashes the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and spits out punchy Warners-First National dialogue with all the customary, and expected, panache. The psychology in this crisp antique, one of Warners' many efforts to assert its place as the ""socially conscious"" studio, doesn't run deep: Digges is bad just because the script requires him to be, and there's the quaint notion that juvenile delinquents will turn into swell kids if they're just given a dash of autonomy. But it's made in that spare, fast style that the studio specialized in, and it never bores. Frankie Darro, who got into all kinds of onscreen trouble during a brief tenure as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD -- a handsome, charismatic toughie with a pug nose and a hate-filled stare that could wither steel. No kid actor today can touch him.",2
I have been patronizing this place since 20+ years back. The chicken kuah hitam hits the spot all the time. I even had pregnancy craving last year for this nasi Kandar and surprised as how the pricing is still good ol eventhough the location is central.My must have whenever I go to KL. Yummeh!,2
"This place is AMAZING! it has a very \""artsy\"" bistro feel. When you walk in, you immediately feel welcome. The service was impeccable and of course the home made pasta is as good as it gets. Everything is fresh, and made from scratch. This is definitely a little gem. The best part was the we actually had Glenn (one of the brothers) wait on us due to a staffing issue. Apparently this never happens, well let me tell you.. Of course we will be back because the food was Fantastic, but having the opportunity to sit down and get to know Glenn himself was awesome. I even got some pasta to take home...Delish! Do yourself a favor and stop in for an amazing experience!",2
I sent the wrong phone description and could have easily offered me a lower price but you made me aware and offered me the appropriate value,2
"Chain hotels are not my thing, so I was delighted with my three night stay at the Canterbury. This is a classy, historic hotel, and a unique property. The owners are on site. The staff--many of whom have worked there for years--are great. There is a good restaurant (24 hour room service) and a clubby bar. The building is old, but I understand there is a renovation going on, and I did see two crews working while I was there. In a perfect world, I would have preferred more deluxe linens, and the decor and furnishings could use some sprucing up. But if you value old fashioned charm above modern sterility, then this is the place for you. And the piano player in the lobby was playing Beethoven as I checked in! PS There is no fitness center, but they will provide a day pass to a great gym nearby.",2
Nice app!! Support to be legal!,2
im feeling sorta smug that i have an extra shade,2

"If you're not willing to read the extended version of my review, just know this...\nIf you are a true sushi enthusiast, you must go to Sushi Samba to experience the most PHENOMENAL SUSHI ever!\n\nMy boyfriend and I got to Sushi Samba at around 12am on Saturday. It was packed with pretty people and the DJ was bumpin' the beats! We didn't need a reservation and were seated quickly. If you're like us and willing to splurge on a palate party sensation, then continue on with reading my review.\n\nWe were greeted by our fabulously bubbly (*not in an annoying way*) and knowledgeable server Isabella Monstrous (she gave me her business card *how cute is that*). She recommended the Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos (they look more like mini tacos really)...man was she SPOT ON! These little tasty tacos were filled with fresh yellowtail pieces that were swimming in spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime! They were so delish we decided to get a second order. Then we continued on our tasting tour with the following dishes that were the highlights of our night (we ordered more than this, but I don't want to write a colossal review):\n\n* Assortment of four - *My Favorites!!!\no Yellowtail (Jalape\u00f1o and lemon grass)*\no Kanpachi (Yuzu, sea salt, black truffle oil*)\no Tuna (granny smith apple, serrano, lime)*\no Salmon (orange and mustard miso)\n\n* Seared Wagyu Beef* (ponzu gel\u00e9e, warm japanese mushroom, truffled tofu crema)\no This was my absolute favorite thing of the night!!!! This sauce was amazing over the Coconut Rice (flavors were savory, not sweet, coconut flavor was not over powering). The Wagyu beef was so buttery and melted in my mouth. \n* Rock Shrimp (creamy and crispy deliciousness)\n* Dessert - Samba Split\no I cannot even begin to describe how exceptional this dessert was! I was pretty tipsy by the end of our dinner thanks to a 720 bottle of Komotsuru sake ($115, but so worth it, fruity, light flavor and gold flakes don't come cheap). All I remember is decadent coconutty and dulce de leche creamy goodness! Seriously, when I took my first bite it was like...\""COME ON, REALLY?\"" I wanted to get another. Thank goodness for my boyfriend's fatty prevention intervention! Good lookin' out my man!\n\nOverall we loved this place because the tapas style servings were perfect for a couple who wanted to try a little of everything. Their Brazilian play on sushi fusion is quite genius and it works! \n\nThe restaurant is bright and beautiful and most importantly the attentive and knowledgeable servers and wait staff make your meal so much more enjoyable! Our bill including tip was over $400, but I truly feel like it was worth every penny! My boyfriend and I will definitely be going back to Sushi Samba the next time we're in Vegas!",2
"Stayed at Hotel 373 12/13-12/15 based upon Tripadvisor reviews. The good: very nice staff and clean room. However, the outside noise was extreme. In the past we have stayed at a hotel in Chicago next to the el and this was much much worse. I'm not talking about the ususal traffic or sirens, as I'm from NYC and am not bothered by those sounds. On 5th ave there are these metal plates and each time a vehicle goes over them it sounded like a bomb going off. Not kidding. Called the front desk at 1 AM and was told there was no other room available that night but I could have a Queen sized room the next day (apparently the Queens are in a more sound proof section). Next morning when I inquired I was told no queens were available. We were given another room that had less noise but wasn't great. We made the reservations about 3 months ago, was for 2 adults, and arranged through the hotel website so think they could have given us a better room. In the rooms most affected by the noise they should consider installing more soundproof windows. Did not mind the small size of the room that much but the second room we had was much better. First night maybe slept around 3 hours.",2
"I use this app on a daily, regular basis and it is very efficient to communicate with people, even internationally. I have Messenger installed on my tablet and mobile, and I've recently had a slight problem where the nicknames and chat emoji of certain contacts just go away randomly from one device, or change into ones I have in group chats. Also, I would like to suggest to create a section in which all the group chats you're present in show, like how it was a few updates back. Thanks :)",2
"i have been to blue about 4 times, i think, and i've never been disappointed. everything i've eaten here has been wonderful. hummus: delicious. red peppers stuffed with goat cheese: to die for. filet a la blue: done gone to heaven. \n\ni recently came here with a big party and we had a little room off to the side which was just us after the other tables finished up. every person there was pleased with their meals and almost everyone ordered something different. to start we got a couple of appetizer trays. we had calamari, arancini di riso (risotto balls), maybe some kind of fried ravioli or something else? i'm not sure. we had a lot of food. one person ordered the moroccan chicken, another the salmon, another the duo of wild boar, two of us had filet a la blue, there was another steak and another fish too. everything was perfectly presented. the waiter was friendly but not intrusive. he even hooked us up with a special event dessert platter. pumpkin cheesecake, lava cake, and something else. \n\nmy only complaint this time around was my \""extra dirty\"" martini was not really dirty at all. but they did me a solid and sent out a cup of olive juice so i could make it as dirty as i pleased. :) can't wait to go back again!",2

"Just got back from EVOO. I live one block from this restaurant. I've passed by this place so many times but the name and under the name, EVOO, \""Cuisine Soign\u00e9e\"" bothered me.. ( (whisper) the real fine dining, fine cuisine restaurants don't say they serve fine cuisine, don't ya think? :P) \n\nWell~ This morning inspired by New York Time <url> decided to try my neighborhood restaurant while I live here - Oh~ I am moving out of Montreal the end of this month so I need to go to all the places that I want to go and yelp it !\n\nHummmm Scones! I wanted to eat as dessert but I was full :P Order it as starter. You will love it. It kinda reminded Lawrence donuts( I love them too ) but it was scone :) Yumm!\n\nThe eggs are perfectly cooked. All the breakfast meats were super yummy. \nMy husband said it's the best breakfast place in Montreal. I think so too. ( better than Lawrence) All the ingredients seem very fresh and high quality.\n\nThe name isn't that attractive but other than that everything was great :)",2

Lovely boutique-style hotel near Union Square. Stayed with my 90-year old father and the front desk and bell staff provided wonderful service. The public areas are lovely and it was delightful to see guests with their dogs. Many fun eateries nearby within walking distance. Close to cable cars and shopping.,2

"I had a rough start to my experience at this store. I knew I was going to be late to my Genius Bar appt. I called in on my way from Tempe and the lady said she'd make a note on my appt but it was ok.\n\nWhen I got there, a red-headed lady attempted to check me in. Once she found out I was late she started arguing with me and tried sending me to another store so I walked out angry. In the parking lot I called the store again to complain about what happened.\n\nThey had me go back in to speak with a manager who squeezed me in as soon as she could and the lead technician got my MacBook Pro in for repair.\n\nApple came through after almost losing me as a customer today. Thanks.",2

"Nos alojamos ocho días en una habitación estándar del hotel New York Palace. La habitación que nos dieron quedaba en un piso alto, y tenía una vista espectacular sobre la catedral de San Patricio y los edificios que la rodean. La ubicación del hotel es perfecta. El cuarto tenia buen tamaño, buenas camas, buen baño y buen servicio. Volvería a alojarme allí. Lo único que no me gusto es que los precios de cualquier servicio extra (desayunos, lavandería, room service, etc.) son escandalosamente caros. Por lo cual optamos por desayunarnos fuera del hotel. Hay una gran cantidad de sitios para comer cerca que son muchísimo más económicos. De resto me gusto y volveria.",2

"This is a decent little flick made in Michigan, about a guy that is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted. In fact, he's absolutely bonkers, but tries not to be too obvious. He's got an entourage too, his own little demon & angel that follow him around. The demon never says a word but really, doesn't have to, and he's Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this, as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like ""freeing"" people that he decides need it, mostly beautiful young women. This is a decent portrayal of madness, and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on, but overall, I watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest. It's a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on. A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks.",2
"This last time I went to Vegas it was a budget trip (I was going to visit my brother and not spend my savings) and Ellis Island fit the bill perfectly.\n\nThe place is a dive, it's on the outskirts of the strip, it's old with low ceilings and the casino smells smokier than most. My first reaction upon my arrival was \""uhhhh\"" with some mild hesitance. It's definitely a locals hangout and everyone seems to be over the age of 50. Save that, this place is great.\n\n$1 house beers, ambers, lagers, hefweizen and rootbeer. The root beer is amazing. Not too sweet, just enough carbonation and smooth. I know who knew rootbeer could be so good? The beers are also more than decent and blow PBR away and the best part is that they're a $1 and they're draft. I'm in love with the root beer so I tend to get that.\n\nI had a prime rib dinner and the chicken fried steak. Both were excellent for the price. $11.99 for the prime rib dinner which came with a salad and sides. Okay it's not the BEST prime rib you'll ever have, but for $12, it blows all the other budget steak dinners on the strip away, it also comes with a free beer! $7.99 for the chicken fried steak was yummy, gravy was spot on and the meat was well seasoned and soooo tender. \n\nI would have eaten their BBQ but the line was too long. even though I hear good things. If you sign up for the Player's Club you get $3-4 off on the BBQ. Best part is that the place is open 24/7 sans BBQ.",2

What's not to love about this restaurant? I've been wanting to try it forever and finally got a chance yesterday! The restaurant has a nice big open feel and is way cute inside. Lori (spelling) was a gracious host. She started us off with some caramel kettle corn. Delish! I could have just eaten this alone! I ordered the Cuban B and the Elote and my friend ordered the pretzel brats! Amazingly good! Never had Elote this good. So much flavor packed into each dish. We shared the churronut with pistachio ice cream for dessert. Yummy! I unfortunately didn't take pictures but will be back!,2
i was thrown into the deep end and didnt have much time to get a feel for things before i was running around aimlessly trying to figure out what to do to be useful,2

And the good news is I don't have to save for months to do so, because forequarter.. my friend... is affordable. (And I'm beyond grateful for that.)\n\nWe began with the cheese plate served with house made peach, raspberry & almond jam that tasted like pure fall. (Move over psl chicas in your uggs.)\n\nI put my foot down with the beets cooked with coffee & rye. Served warm over cocoa & hibiscus, micro greens & buttermilk ice cream. The mixture was simply devine.\n\nThe mushrooms... the lightly fried oyster & shiitake mushrooms with pickled Serrano peppers, sprouted lentils, salted lime curd & balsamic reduction. Had that miraculous concoction not been served on a wooden board, I surely would have licked the serving platter clean.\n\nAnd then they had croissant cake for dessert! CROISSANT CAKE!!! \n\nIt was a happy birthday indeed. Thank you forequarter. Thank you.\n\nIf you are even considering going here, put down your computer, ipad or mobile device & head towards 708 E Johnson. Now. You won't be sorry.",2

The Great platform,2
"Awesome little find in an unassuming place. The building looks like it could be a building supply center but actually is home to a Koren grocery. Entrance is on the side where the grocery extends to the left and seating is straight ahead for the restaurant. I believe there is another dining area just to the right of the main (suspect they started serving there and expended.) Nice dining area and very clean. Service was attentive (little \""service\"" bell on the table as the kitchen is out of eye sight of the dining room) and fast. I ordered the seafood & tofu soup. It was served hot, well seasoned spice wise and not too salty. Plenty of big chunks of tofu and seafood. I also ordered the dolsot bibimbap. Came out sizzling, as it should, with a slightly fried egg on top. It mixed up well and formed that nice crispy rice on the bowl walls. Great, freshly prepared meal with a nice variety of sides. Go, go, go!",2

"Very cute and flattering skirt!
This skirt is super cute and very flattering. I had bought 2 different styles at the same time. One I hated and was to short and seemed for kids but this skirt was very cute! The buttons on side are nice addition and the slit is flattering. I'm 5'1 and 115lbs and got the medium because I saw it runs small.",2
"Great taste, efficient service (we order often at work and at home from this restaurant, as well as pick up). Never been let down, always tasty and solid portions. Usually take either chicken pitas or doner pitas, fries and salad are tasty as well and the tzatziki is one of the best out there.",2
This is an excellent place for breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and my meal was exactly what I needed. The coffee is the best! I came on a Friday morning so it was busy but I didn't have to wait for a table I just sat at the breakfast bar. Will return. :-),2
The Healing joint is a fantastic facility for both chiropractic and wellness needs. Dr. D is wonderful. He is a true healer who is there to help you get better. His vast knowledge and kindness truly makes him fantastic at what he does. Both my husband and I have gone to him for treatment and he has helped us both with our issues. I had a knee injury from running and because of Dr. D my knee feels great and I am running again with no problems. My husband and I also take advantage of the great monthly deal that is offered. The Jade bed and sauna are wonderful and so relaxing and the 60 minute massage is amazing. All of the massage therapists that I have had are great and very professional and knowledgeable. The Healing Joint is truly a wonderful place. The friendly and knowledgeable staff gives the place a wonderful sense of community and comfort. I look forward to my time there and highly recommend this place for your wellness journey.,2

I really like that the menu items are named for familiar dishes even though, of course they are meatless. The seitan in the Philly cheese gives a very satisfying texture and mouth feel. The location is little bit out of the way for me or I would go more often...",2

"The friendly, well-priced Eventi has a lot to offer. It is new and well-decorated, the rooms and baths are comfortable and well-equipped, and the service is friendly. We had a quiet room, a corner room on the 6th floor. The only thing we heard was an occasional honk and we slept quite well. The bed was comfy and the air conditioner functioned quite well.
Free coffee in the morning was good and complimentary wine in the early evening was lovely - good Australian wine on the attractive terrace. There is also always-cold, slightly flavored water available in the lobby.
When the room was not cleaned as scheduled, a phone call took care of the problem within 10 minutes. Mistakes can happen - what sets a place apart is how they deal with them. This hotel knows how to do that.
And last but not least, the Food Park next door is a great, inexpensive source for all sorts of breakfasts. The Basque restaurant upstairs served us an excellent meal one night before we walked to the theater.
We would definitely return!",2

"Ten of us were travelling to Chicago for a family wedding. For five of the group it was their first visit to the USA and for all but one of us it was our first visit to Chicago. We had decided that we would really treat ourselves and booked a luxury 7 bed town house called Chateau Avalon through a rental company called Elite Chicago Rentals at elitechicagorentals.com We complied with all the terms of the rental, paid a hefty deposit and the full balance on the due date. Just days before we flew to the USA the woman at the property management company e-mailed by niece who had made the booking to say that the property ""had been damaged"" and we couldn't have it. My niece asked if she had any other properties of a similar size and was told ""no."" She asked if we could rent several smaller places to take us all, ""no."" Could she recommend any other property rental places - ""no."" Sooooooooooo helpful - NOT!. They even had the audacity to say it would take 7 to 10 days to refund the the thousands of dollars we had paid up front. it was paid back in two instalments and only after several e-mail enquiries. Would I use Elite Chicago Rentals again? Never in a million years!!!! Anyway, it was our lucky day as our niece managed to get 4 studio apartments in the Residence Inn in North Dearborn Street. The rooms are OK and are very well equipped and reasonably priced but what makes the place is the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. It was a pleasure to stay there. Close enough to walk into the city centre, a great steakhouse called Harry Carray's on the opposite corner and a great bar with live music called ""Howl at the Moon"" a few minutes walk in the opposite direction. Go there when they have the pianists and the rest of the band on - they're great. While you're there try a bucket of cocktails - yes, that's right, a bucket! Save yourself a bunch of heartache and stay at the Residence Inn rather than trying to rent a place off of Elite Chicago Rentals. You'll have a great stay. Loved Chicago by the way.",2
"We needed to check in at 3:30 pm and then go to graduation, but the rooms weren't cleaned until 7 pm. That's poor planning for a hotel that knew they were sold out the previous night and would need extra cleaning help. And, my husband was scalded in the parking garage but hot water dripping from ceiling pipes. Also, the room needs updating; shower diverter wasn't working properly so half of the water went straight down the drain. The only great thing was the comfortable bed.",2
"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary. When we got to the room, they had a nice note out congratulating us and a complimentary bottle of Preseco.

Overall, a great botique hotel and a very cosmopolitan feel.",2

"I came in not too long ago. My thought process was \""I just need a phone.\"" The wait was typical for a busy store (which it was) the sales people were friendly with other guest from what I saw. It finally was my turn, the sales person asked me what he could help with and I stated, \""I need a phone.\"" So, he sold me a phone. There was nothing really fancy about my transaction. David was nice and wasn't pushy. I made all the decisions without being persuaded. I left for an hour while my information was being transferred from phone to phone. I came back, the tech Dave handed me my new IPhone with a smile on his face and shook my hand. I left a completely satisfied customer.",2

"Without question, the Hotel Monaco in Chicago is the best hotel we have ever visited in our 14 years of marriage!
From the moment we arrived, everyone on the hotel staff made our stay a delight. The doorman and porters were very gracious and helpful; the front desk staff always addressed us by name and always answered our questions clearly; and our room was exceptional!
We stayed in the Mediterranean Suite on the 8th floor, and it looks EXACTLY as wonderful in person as it does on the hotel's website. We became Kimpton In-Touch Members when we made this reservation, and the room was selected according to the preferences we listed: the shower was extra tall, the room was located on a corner, and our area of the hotel was so quiet I was never entirely sure anyone else was staying on our floor.
But the sweetest thing was that, when I made the reservation, I was asked whether we were celebrating a special occasion, and I mentioned that the month we were traveling was the anniversary of our first date...and when we returned to the suite after an afternoon out-and-about, there was champagne on ice waiting for us. Too nice!
The decor was lovely and fun; the staff was wonderful; the location was perfect; and the wine reception each afternoon was just delightful! We will definitely return to the Monaco!",2

"Rent this, I own the DVD, got it for $9.99. A steal being so under-rated. Sure, there are better movies. Movies with fewer or no holes in the plot or action. BUt I don't have that problem with this movie. For me if a movie stays true to itself, honest and exploitive of its flaws (and virtues, obviously!) in the name of entertainment, then it has fulfilled its purpose. I got me to care, because its makers cared. The entire movie is preposterous from beginning to end, but its makers took the whole undertaking seriously, And I did not feel manipulated into taking the movie seriously. And that is so true, because I want to take every movie seriously yet many, oh so many, let me down. For all of its preposterousness, this movie is almost perfect, and completely entertaining!What a funny screenplay! It also has become eerily relevant in light of the events on 9/11. In no way do I seek to minimize the loss. But this movie incorporates the tradegy of the WTC collapse before it happened in ways that we will never see had the movie been made after those events.""...it's either gone for good, or here to stay.""

"My husband & I stayed here for 4 nights while he was attending a conference in May. Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of the river. The view would have been excellent except for the moisture in the windows which blurred the view. It was a nice room but not a 4 star room. I would give it 3 1/2 stars.
The bed was very comfortable & we did get a king room (which my husband had requested). Also good fluffy pillows. However our bathroom seemed old. The lighting was very dim - not good for shaving or putting on makeup. I stopped by the front desk & mentioned it to the girl on duty. She was very pleasant & confirmed that a number of people had complained about the lights.
We liked its location & were able to walk to many places like the Art Institute of Chicago, Millenium Park, the Magnificent Mile, etc. The one evening when my husband had a business dinner, I walked to the Oriental Theatre by myself to see ""Wicked"" which I'd highly recommend.
We used the concierge services 2 times & received good service. The concierge desks are setup like podiums close to the main check-in area.",2

One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars.",2
"I go here often with a group of friends and whenever friends come in to town for a visit we take them here as well as another excuse to go. This place is always a blast and the food is always on point. The price is fairly decent for what you get and the service has always been outstanding for us when we go but maybe thats just because they see us in here every week to every other week. You order by the half pound or the pound depending how much you can eat. I usually go with the sausage and the shrimp and throw in 2 corns with the \""whole shibang\"" and it always hits the spot. The Cajun fries is something i tend to also order as another fav to add to my meal. Parking is easy as there is alot of it. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Def a spot i think people need to check out.",2
"We stayed here for 3 nights. Really friendly staff, always a hello when you passed by reception. Room was large (2 doubles though only needed one), quiet and very clean.
It is so centrally located and right next to Grand Central which has great subway links to all of Manhattan and beyond.
Only downside we had to wait until 4pm (check in was 3pm) to have a room allocated and the beds were too soft for our liking. Saying that we would most definitely stay here again.",2
"Neat
Adjusting the links to fit my wrist was as painful as a bareback gorilla slinging me around a room full of plywood. Otherwise 9/10 totally would buy this shit again.",2
We came for an appointment at UCSF for my granddaughter and the motel that was paid for was truly disgusting. We contacted the Comfort Inn at the last minute and were able to book a room that was truly beautiful with a great view of the golden gate bridge. Their staff was so friendly and helpful that it was a highlight of our stay. When we have to return to SF in a few months for another appointment we plan on staying here and NOT at either motel that the program pays for. Truly a wonderful experience with great service and would highly recommend to anyone traveling to SF for a medical appointment as a place to stay!,2

Went for brunch before flying out on a Sunday. Told the waitress we had to be out in less than an hour and she totally made that happen. The bellini and my friend's drink (the cocktail w grand mariner) were both delicious. We split a cinnamon roll which was amazing esp for $3. We both got the veggie egg scramble. Delicious! And loved the restaurant's bread as well. Service was excellent.,2

"This hotel is awesome. Everyone was really friendly and nice. Check in was a breeze even when we checked in early at 11AM. They honored our requests for a higher floor and quiet room, etc. There are free wifi internet, free printing in the great business room, free fitness room (machines, weights, towels, and great view of the city on the 15th floor), free shuttle to the surrounding areas, and free heated roof deck pool! We had a breakfast buffet in the restaurant next door. It was only $16 / person. Very reasonable.
The room was comfortable and clean as well as the rest of the hotel. The location is closer to the capital and 16th Street. I was able to walk to the convention center with luggage no problem in about 10 minutes.
When it rained on the second day of our stay, the staff even provided umbrellas for us.",2
"I personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so I had a good feeling about watching this ""Don't Look in the Basement"", even though its reputation is doubtful. Well, turned out I was right! This is great, trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters. You have to, of course, look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but, if you manage to do that (and if you're a fan of this type of horror, that's an essential quality), you'll be rewarded with an outrageous ""video-nasty"" in which blood and insanity form the main elements. The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she's supposed to start her new job. She finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival. The life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar, with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked. After a whole series of bizarre events, Charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides.... The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the completely deranged climax. Everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun. The asylum's patients are textbook lunatics, but I love them nevertheless. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still talks exclusively in legal terms), the suspicious army-Sargeant and the mad-raving old lady. ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is great low-brained fun, especially recommended to fans of 70's trash-cinema, sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics have taken over the asylum, yeah!!",2
"This hotel is real find. It has been recently updated, the rooms are very nice a good mix between modern and classic styling.

Room was clean, comfy, staff pleasant, breakfast fine, although the 1 evening meal there was disappointing. There is a large late night Walgreen supermarket across the street which had food, toiletries, drinks etc etc, plenty of eating places around. Highly recommend Boudins on the Wharf for breakfast, sourdough soup and ambience. Really recommend taking yr own hairdryer to Holiday Inns in the US, the ones supplied are weak and lethal!",2

I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.

This connection has made getting to and from appointments, surgery, and pharmacy much easier. The staff is very kind, which is appreciated. Housekeeping, while efficient once in the room, does need a nudge to get them in there in the first place. There is no pool, which has made keeping the children busy a little tough. The breakfast is very good, and leans on the healthier side! I would stay here again if I had to return to the hospital.",2

"********Spoilers--Careful*********What can I say? I'm biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have watched it countless times--and usually find out something new about it with each viewing.I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in either L.A. or New York. Well, it is true except for Pam.Travolta plays Bud, a small town Texas boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is when Travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys/good guys in big budget movies. This is a really good movie--the mechanical bull riding contest and two-step dancing may be silly, but you have to enjoy this for what it is.Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance)--and soon after, they are married and living in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, men's roles are not as clear. Where can Bud prove he's a real man? He can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night--he can be a ""urban cowboy."" But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. So where does this leave Bud? As Sissy asserts her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider--, Wes (played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened, and Bud and Sissy break up.Sissy shacks up with Wes, who abuses her. Emasculating himself further, Bud becomes the boy toy of Pam, a rich girl whose Daddy is in oil and all that implies. Sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up--Pam doesn't do that kind of thing. She writes a make up letter to Bud, but evil Pam tears it up and takes the credit for Sissy's housework.Bud's Uncle Bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance at reconciliation, but are too stubborn. Later the mechanical bull riding competition is at Gilley's, and you know Bud is going to win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy--he did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys, but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.Of course, you may ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys about every night and ""live like pigs."" Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. Or why didn't Bud stay with Pam--she wasn't that bad and had money. Or why they had to kill off Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to break them up: Marshall says to Bud, ""She {Sissy} rides that bull better than you do!"" But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is making fun of it a little bit--and saying, isn't that Bonnie Raitt on the stage!",2

If I remember correctly, this was the film that introduced me to Fred Astaire so I suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr*p but I'm woman so get over it)All in all this film gets an 8/10 from me.

"Popped into here after seeing the shop refurb and development on facebook a while after they had first opened. My other half is vegan so it was great to see that they advertise which food items are vegan, veggie etc. I opted for my favourite sandwich of pastrami, Swiss, pickles etc (very NY I am told). The vegan option was a Hummus, sun blush tomatoes, olives and red onion sourdough sandwich, which met with approval. I noticed that the house coffee was called slayer, being the rampant metal head I had to have a cup of this. The coffee was great as was our food! \n\nWe didn't eat in on the day as the sun was shining and George square was calling, so sitting in a coffee shop with bright young things and their iThingy devices browsing FB didn't appeal. However the place looked really nice - lots of comfy sofas, some largish tables for bigger groups and some really nice quirky design ideas (The hole in the wall brick work springs to mind). I would happily bring a book here on a rainy day and drift through an afternoon. I will definitely be back.\n\nLast but not least the staff were great friendly and very efficient even though the place was busy.",2

While there are so many enticing menu options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water. \n\nThe rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes, except for my mom. She really didn't like the red pepper soup, although she's not one to complain. Our waiter noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it.

Both of the rooms were beautifully appointed and immaculate. The staff was warm, friendly and efficient. I highly recommend this hotel.",2

"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres. If you're not a big fan of those things--psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and the ""acid trip aesthetic"" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this film. On the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff, you need to run out and buy Head now if you haven't already.Oddly, the film has never received much respect. That probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all, it does star The Monkees--Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork--and The Monkees were a musical group of actors put together by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be a kid-friendly, bubble-gummy Beatles for a television series. In their era, they had as much respect as, say, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls, and so on. As a fellow IMDb reviewer rightly notes--""Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see (Head)"".The Monkees and Head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception. It's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in The Monkees. It's probably odder that Rafelson, who directs here and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, _that_ Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produces, decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly put out an album equivalent to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in Head, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a Floyd-like quality, somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more prominent than any Beatles similarity. Some people have complained about the music in the film, but to me, all the songs are gems. For that matter, some people dislike Barrett era (or other) Floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with.But what _is_ Head about? The basic gist is just that The Monkees are taking a trip through various film genres--there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes, and on and on. Except, in the film's reality, this turns out to be happening primarily (if not exclusively) on a studio lot. At root, we're watching The Monkees shoot a film. Of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self-referential about them, and they, and individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to one another using dream logic not dissimilar to the Monty Python television show. As a dream, Head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep (something that I frequently do, by the way).Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room, wearing a combination of white and black reversed in each, that occasionally toggles back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time), there are a lot of bizarre segues, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. For my money, I wish this stuff wasn't just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I relish. It seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see films like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques. Now that would make that film surreal.Interpretationally, some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b.s. to offer meanings for something intended to not have any. I disagree with such a pessimistic/nihilistic view; Head was intended to have a lot of meaning(s), and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about The Monkees--the film postmodernistically comments on their manufactured status; pop stardom--way before Pink Floyd, Head conflates pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans cannibalistically dismantling their idols; and naïve U.S.-oriented ideas of international perceptions and respect--well-armed foreigners in a desert surrender to Micky Dolenz just because he's an American, then later they blow up a Coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he's thirsty and can't gain access. The film comments on many other topics--from big Industry to police, surveys, spectatorship (especially in relation to tragedies), and on and on. Head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with intelligent, multifaceted things to say about them.Head deserves to be considered a classic--it's basically shooting for the same vibe as The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. Both premiered in November of 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as something of a summation of the psychedelic aesthetic. Yellow Submarine wasn't quite successful. Head is everything Yellow Submarine should have been.",2

We stayed for the fourth of July and while we could not see the Lake Union fireworks from the hotel, we could see at least 5 other shows on Puget Sound.

"I have stayed often at the Affinia 50 due to its good value and perfect location. Its location is a bit quieter than some more central hotels and the very large, well priced suites make it an excellent location for a family as it easy comfortable for four persons. The kitchen is an added benefit as it allows one to have breakfast in the room. I stay here when i am in Ny for more than a couple of days, as I can set up a small office, holding meetings, and just relax, without having to sit on the bed. It is not the most posh hotel in town, with worn carpets, window treatments and dated kitchens. The internet connection can be sketchy, but management is working to improve its reliability. I will say again.",2
"We can't add much to the previous reviews. It's a great hotel. Perhaps the only thing we can add is a comment about the Executive Level. Plain and simple, it's really not worth it. All rooms are comfortable and gorgeously appointed. The Executive Level (22nd floor) rooms are similar to the other levels, although being a little higher, may have a slightly nicer view...but, of course, you don't stay in a downtown Houston hotel for the view. The Executive lounge was nice and somewhat similar to an airline club room. Morning continental breakfast is nice, but not special. Evening snacks nice, but not special. Drinks are hotel bar rate (i.e. rather expensive). If you need privacy and quiet, maybe the $30 or so per night is worth it. Internet access is free on this level as opposed to around $12/night on other floors.",2

We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while visiting the Inner Harbor. This hotel was not family friendly at all. The hotel is very modern and sleek and not very welcoming. To use the pool you need to parade throught a restaurant and past a million and one people in a private gym just to get there. And when you do get there you are only allowed to use the one small little pool in the back if you have kids under 16. And our room wasn't ready even after check in time. Overall a crappy experience.

On the contrary the proactive mid-flight runs to keep passengers hydrated (trays with water and orange juice) weren’t many. Unproblematic transfer in Taipei for the onward journey to Jakarta.

"This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren, however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain!. The story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this!. The action scenes are excellent, and it's almost like Die Hard except it's set in a school!, plus Kata Dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!. The finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because Alex Karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too OTT, and laughable for my tastes. This should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!. The ending is very amusing,and Corey Sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus Dolph has still got it!. This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Lundgren!, but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Sidney J. Furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. There is a bit of blood and violence. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff. The Acting is fantastic!. Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (Lundgren Rules!!!!!). Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably OTT, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me. Kata Dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!. Corey Sevier is funny as Mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with Dolph too. Dov Tiefenbach(Willy),Chris Collins(Hogie),Mpho Koaho(Jay Tee),Danielle Hampton(Alicia),Nicole Dicker(Charlee) all do great as the students. Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée. rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",2

"Pros:\n* Incredible food. Just wow.\n* Perfect portions.\n* Beautifully presented.\n* Reasonable prices.\n* Excited and helpful owner puts as much care into the food as customer service.\n\nCons:\n* A bit too difficult to find located at the back of a business plaza.\n\nWith all the amazing reviews for Baguette Cafe I was excited to see what all the positive hype was about. Thankfully, Baguette Cafe did not disappoint! The restaurant was somewhat tricky to find located in the back of a business plaza but well worth the hunt.\n\nThe owner Oliver worked the register and asked if it was my first time at Baguette Cafe. When I said yes he excitedly went over the menu for me and explained the finer details. I ended up ordering a half and half \""The Chicken Sandwich\"" and roasted red pepper soup. My girlfriend ordered \""The Chicken Salad\"" and potato soup. The order arrived promptly and wonderfully presented on a small square plate and small colored cups for the soups. It looked so well made and dressed on the plate my excitement became overwhelming.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was delicious on a fresh, home made baguette, with cheddar cheese, tomato, mixed greens, bacon, superbly seasoned chicken, and a very nice tomato pesto. The ratio of meat, cheese, and bread was perfect and the sandwich oozed with flavor as it melted in my mouth. The red pepper soup was surprising. It tasted similar to a tomato basil which much more of a pepper kick. It had a light creamy taste very rich with flavor. It complimented my sandwich well. I had a bite of my girlfriend's combo and her salad, although dressed with a vinaigrette unsuitable for my tastes, had a nice flavor. Her soup was possibly the best potato soup I have ever had.\n\nThe cafe is welcoming and decorated with white walls, warm red-orange accents and yellow hanging light fixtures. It suits the establishment and their lunch driven menu well. The owner Oliver was very pleasant and assisted in the overall great vibe. The prices are very reasonable and go well with the perfectly sized portions. I had a great time at the Baguette Cafe and will surely return again.",2

"The whole stay, I found myself thinking ""This is it?"" We were there over the New Year holiday and everything else in New York was about as great as it could be. The only negative we experienced the whole time we were there was our hotel. I dreaded going back to the W. I usually love the W, so this hotel was a disappointment. My friends have recently stayed at the Marriott just down the street and I wish I had too. It makes me very sad to say that, but it's the truth.",2
"Even if you don't consider yourself a whiskey fan, I would highly recommend taking the tour. Not only will you learn how whiskey and other spirits are made, you will also learn the history behind distilleries in Pennsylvania. Haven't you always wanted to know why there's a noose on the Wigle logo? This is a family run business, and the owners seemed very friendly and knowledgeable. I like the fact that they use locally sourced grains, and the resulting product is also quite drinkable. :-) They offer five dollar cocktails every evening, and the one which I tried was delicious.",2
There's so many reviews of this show so there isn't really anything new for me to say. BUT please please go see this show! It's so mindblowingly awesome!\n\nHonestly I'm not a huge fan of Cirque shows. I've seen 4 in my lifetime and though they were good but not great. I saw O at Bellagio and thought it wasn't that impressive. But KA was so crazy! You need to go see it! That's all I'm going to say.,2
Very customer orientated. Embarkation was smooth and welcoming. On board service was highly efficient and pleasant. Food was good standard -choice chicken mushroom ragout or quiche with generous glasses of wine. Seating was comfortable with sufficient leg-room and entertainment good. Toilets were spotless throughout. All in all a pleasant experience .,2
"AMAZING! Went there for my birthday dinner, July 26th..Everything was phenomenal! The service was spot-on and our waiter, Kevin was knowledgeable, personable, and very enthusiastic! Never did our water run low, we were checked on frequently and treated like VIP's at every point in our experience there..The lobster arancini was delectable...the spicy pomodoro sauce that accompanies it, we both agreed, we would have happily drank from a bowl! The bread basket is wonderful...especially Giada's rosemary bread! We shared, and highly recommend, both the lemon spaghetti and the veal saltimbucca. The combination of flavors in the lemon spaghetti sauce with roasted capers was scrumptious and the prawns are enormous! The veal saltimbucca is the kind of dish I will dream about and crave to taste again! We also shared the salad tre colore, which we also enjoyed. Both cocktails we ordered were unique and memorable and delicious. Our favorite was the Destroyer, but we also enjoyed the Le Strada! My only regret is that we didn't have room for dessert. We will definitely return and look forward to trying dessert next time!",2

"I had (another) broken screen in my iPhone. It was fixed in less than 90 minutes. CJ and the receptionist were sweet and helpful. Price was reasonable too: $79 for the screen fix, $15 for a new battery (I mentioned it seemed like the phone wasn't holding a charge well so he offered to replace the battery at a reduced price) = $94 out the door. I couldn't be happier.",2

"Flight booked for travel in May.
Usually cautious, I advertently called a scam travel agency disguised as SA inquiring on how to complete the name fields on their website.
By the time I realized I was being scammed, they had already gotten my booking reference number and last name.
Lesson learned.
The scammer did not have my credit card details but had access to my reservation and could change or cancel my reservation at any time.
I pleaded with several SA agents to protect my booking reference by adding a password or change my number to no avail.
Finally, I was lucky to have this amazing SA agent take my call.
He was very cordial. When I explained what happend, he submitted a request to a change my booking reference number. He called the next day to confirm approval of a new number and patiently went through my reservation to be sure the information was accurate.
Wow! I'm so grateful this kind agent went out of his way to help!",2
"It's really annoying that every time you change your cover photo it insists on making a status. Then you can't even delete the status. I was able to change the privacy on the status to private but it's still just kind of dumb. I have a lot of older people on my friends list and the fact that it literally says ""so-and-so changed her cover photo"" featuring my random astronaut photo, means I then have to explain what a cover photo is. It's just annoying, it should give the option to skip the status",2
"It is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old, fast, or exotic cars. It has a plot and a lot of action.

"If you want mindless action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this is the show for you!The concept of Dark Angel isn't anything new (in fact, there's controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but I spend the entire hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish.Jessica Alba is smoking and Max' friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just as hot. The fight scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max need to be a little bit better (the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it).In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for hard hitting, award-winning drama, go watch ""The West Wing"" or something.",2

"Good product, slight design flaw
4 stars because it’s a decent glove liner. Not 5 because the pouch that holds the hand warmer opens at the top (closer to fingertips than palm) and has no overlapping extra flap, so if you have your hands down by your sides and don’t have a glove on over the liners, the hand warmers will fall out. Other than that, I like them.",2
This place is awesome! Great for vegetarians. HUGE selection! Staff was very friendly. Super fast. And if you are not a vegetarian don't trip. They got your back too! They have hot meals too. Try the shitake mushroom roll. Its amazing.,2
"Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn't fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.I believe that this is the first feature by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start! I saw elements of other directors' influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.Character development is the movie's finest feature. I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the ""racy"" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.",2
"As I reach the ""backside"" of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed, drug influenced teens of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! Watch for a young Laura Dern. Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ? I did have a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff.Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks.I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.",2
"I found Vol 1 to be well written blending both the old and the new. It was true to a singular focus and the characters were unique. I enjoyed the banter between Maggie and Link and it reminded me of the ""Moonlighting"" TV series of years past with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. I admit I wanted to strangle Maggie many times but that was part of her charm (I guess).I don't have any idea of the authenticity of La Malinche or Montezuma's Treasure itself and that is not important. The author made it all believable to me in a fictional way. I give Vol 1 5 stars and commend the author for a job well done.",2
"The manager, Mr Kuhan was a really friendly manager I would say. The other service crews were also so helpful, super kind and quick to act. We were treated so well. Overall, the food was amazing too ! They also provide you with the best singing when it’s your birthday !! ^^",2
"Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.(No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter's ""amazing"" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the ""star power"" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew Aaron) who's review was ""of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!,"" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I'm betting the older charas too) and loving the ""cuteness"" of the child characters.And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, ""Ponyo"" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names Soske (somewhat like ""The Little Mermaid""), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo's Mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. Once human, she teams up with her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will ""remember him fondly."" And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical ""bad guy."" Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a ""bad person."" All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. In the end, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.",2

My fiance complained that the A/C never got cold enough but I was more than comfortable. The water in the shower was bi-polar and changed temperatures every five seconds but there was a sign at check-in that said they are renovating and working on plumbing currently so I'm hoping that wasn't the usual. My major issue was the breakfast buffet. It was weird that I had to write my name, room number, and color of my shirt before I was allowed to eat (there was a very grumpy lady working behind the table) and we couldn't take our food back to the room (we tried and got barked at by the front desk guy). No big issues and easy access to the highway.",2

"My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was recommended to us. I checked out reviews on this site and they were all very good so we were very excited about going to New York. We booked a one bedroom suite and were glad of the extra space as we needed somewhere to store the shopping.
Our first impression of the room was it was a bit dated and it could do with an update however the suite was very clean and the staff looked after us very well. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant and that to me is important. Yes you could hear fire engines but you can here that in this country. You cannot go to New York and expect it to be quiet. We had a great time in NYC but think our expectations were a bit high. If going for a short break it is impossible to do lots of shopping and sight seeing so its either one or the other. We did find that all New Yorkers were very helpful and nice but according to one of the taxi drivers it because of our accent. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you want to be in the thick of it.",2

"Take a subject I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? It so happens that back about 1979, director Robert Altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie. Well, I wouldn't put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. Peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. What Peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. This is all good. I highly recommend ""Dogtown.""",2

"Rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun laughing at it that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better. No talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a chant. I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well. ""Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!"" Whoever Tom is I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie may not have been made. In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.",2

Satara really raises the bar, and in so many ways. A Thai restaurant with a great wine list? Fantastic, and why not?

Hot scenes with Lanyon are always hot and male and no funny strange words or odd moments that were not supposed to be there. I agree with Segwick when he says James is confident about sex - in general that's what comes off in Lanyon's books I've read so far - the scenes are part of the story, an extension of the character and the plot - not an extra thrown in to qualify for erotic. I did have a bit of a hard time getting into this one. Of course the parallel's to Christmas Carol are here and welcomed.",2

"The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.",2

A riparian habitat has been established on the west end past the Arts Center. How can one NOT like Town Lake? There is so much to do.\n\nI walk my dogs here a few times each week and my only complaint is that there is no fenced off dog park. \n\nYou can walk from Rural Road to Priest, cross the bridge on Priest and walk all the way back to Rural Road without ever having to stop for a car, or a red light. If you love being outside and enjoying the beautiful Arizona weather then this is the place to be. Take the light rail to 3rd St and Mill and walk north and you'll see the entrance to this historic park. (Oh yeah, did I mention Tempe Beach Park has been around since the 20s?)",2
Love this place. Of course they are famous for their frozen hot chocolate.. it is amazing. The High heel pump sandwich was very good.. The food is good and a fun place to eat.. I have to go there a few times a year...,2
"I spent five nights at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place recently and had a generally positive experience. The hotel is relatively new, and the design is pleasant and modern. I had a good-size room at the end of a hall with a nice new of Lake Michigan and McCormick Square. The bed was clean and comfortable, the room was nicely laid out, and the shower worked well with good water pressure. Service overall was very good. I ate breakfast at the restaurant a couple times. It was a little pricey, but not out of line with breakfast at other big chain hotels in big cities, and the food was passable. The hotel has a direct, covered bridge connection with the McCormick Place convention center, so if you're attending meetings there, this is a great choice.
May main criticism is the location. It's a great spot for the convention center, but there's not much else in the neighborhood within walking distance. A cab to the Loop area runs $10-12, which can add up over a few days. Also, the workout room is nice but a little small for a hotel this size. There are only four elliptical machines, and they are well used during busy times. The weight machines were hardly used at all. They should get rid of some of the weight machines and add more cardio options.
I had a good experience overall with this hotel and would gladly stay there again.",2
"Tips N Toes Rocks. First class service. \n\nI recommend: (1) calling ahead to inquire about pricing, (2) making an appointment.\n\nThe services are worth every penny. \n\nComments on G.M.'s review below: a 15 min wait time is reasonable....complaining about having to wait, then complaining about being 'rushed through' - I doubt GM is easy to satisfy no matter what the situation. Prices are reasonable for a salon of this caliber.\n\nThe Tips N Toes is busy.....because they are one of the best spas around. No loss if GM never returns.........less waiting for the rest of us!\n\nI recommend: (1) calling ahead to inquire about pricing, (2) making an appointment.\n\nThe services are worth every penny.\n\nAlso, if a customer show appreciation and treats Tips N Toes owners and employees kindly......they will definitley be given the queens/kings treatment!",2
"A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. That was kind of a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. If you are a high school student in Turkey you will find so many things about you here. There are many clues in the movie about its story and ending, some you understand at the moment, some will make sense afterwords, the dialogs were written very cleverly. So these make the movie one of the best Turk movies made in the last years. Do not forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.",2

"We searched for months for the right engagement ring. I was not impressed at all the big name jewelry stores. I ended up at Hyde Park Jewelers at the Biltmore shopping center. I was prepared to be disappointed again with over priced pieces and poor quality. I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the store has a great selection, Nancy went out of her way to make sure the diamond I was looking for was there for me to view. I chose to have my ring crafted and have not been disappointed. It's not a build your own from a selection they offer, like you see on-line. It's an actual person that creates your jewelry by what you design or request. The customer service has been wonderful. Nancy answered all my inquiries and has kept me updated through the whole process. Wish we had started out at this jeweler. I will continue to be a customer in the future and recommend this jewelry store to all my friends.",2
simple and easy for order,2
i feel like they had a fabulous example but they are failing miserably to live up to it,2
"Most people drop by here for their famous herbal jelly which is purportedly good for cooling our body. Occasionally we do like to have their herbal drinks. There is a good variety of selections available which is good for different ailments ie sore throat, cough, cold, flu, etc. They are also available in many shopping malls in Malaysia.",2
"Another wonderful breakfast at my favorite LV breakfast spot. Server Alyssa was delightful. Try the chili omelet. My only complaint: they should make a real dairy product available on the table for coffee instead of your having to ask for it. They serve real butter, so why non-dairy creamer? Spock and I consider this \""illogical\"". Still always 5 stars for me and I've been coming here since the 80's.",2
"We enjoyed our room, our view, and the over all experience. We had the free breakfast with our reservations. The breakfast was great each morning, but watch out for the Southwestern Benedict - it was really spicy. The room had a nice view towards downtown, the restaurant was wonderful, and the help was very useful. I loved my choice of 5 pillows!
Thanks",2
Wow amazing app 😍,2
"This is what a hotel should be! We stayed two nights for our anniversary and had the best hotel stay ever. I choose the City Deluxe room and requested the ""stand by"" upgrade. When we checked in, the front desk clerk told me that my requested upgrade was sold out but to make up for it, they would upgrade us ""higher"" and put us in the Artist suite. It was so nice! Huge living room, two bathrooms and a extremely comfortable bed. I requested a bottle of champagne to be in the room when we arrived and sure enough, it was there, on ice and with glasses. I've made this request at other hotels and for some reason, they never do it. Palomar did it perfectly! We dined at Sable, the adjacent restaurant, and had a great meal. The staff at Sable are some of the best restaurant employees I have ever encountered. I cannot remember the last time I stayed at a hotel and could not find one thing wrong. The Palomar is an exceptional hotel! We'll be back soon!",2
"Always come here when we want Vietnamese foods. Miss my usual waitress this time since she was on vacation and won't be back til next week. I ordered Curry chicken and it was so delicious. My mouth is still watering thinking about it. I also tried the Thai Iced Tea since it is free til the end of April and omg, it is the best Thai Iced Tea I've ever had. My friend had Grilled pork chop over rice and loved it. We will back very soon.",2
"Spent 3 days at Hard Rock Hotel San Deigo on our last leg of our Californian vacation. The Gas Lamp Qtr is perfect if your into partying, pubs, clubs, restaurants and night life - Hard Rock Hotel is on The Gas Lamp qtrs doorstep.
The hotels Roof Top bar on Level 4 is awesome. Definitely worth checking out. Try the Raspberry Mojitos. Delicious!
MaryJanes restaurant and cafe is a great place for a breakfast, especially when you're hung over. pink Berry frozen yoghurt is just outside the hotel. This is yum!
The rooms were spacious and clean but very noisy. You could hear everyone in the corridors and whenever doors slammed shut. Our room looked down onto a court yard where weddings, functions and concerts were held.
In all check in and check out was a breeze, valet staff were helpful and in all a pleasant stay. Would recommend and stay again.",2
"A friend recommended the True Runner store in Shadyside to me after I had posted on Facebook about my relatively new hiking/running shoes causing me foot pain. The staff at this store is amazing! I ran on the treadmill and had my gait analyzed, which was waaay cool. They actually take a video of your feet while you run, and then show you the video on an iPad! How cool and state-of-the-art is that? \n\nThe analysis enabled the store's talented sales manager, Ian Shreckengast, to show me ONLY the shoes that would specifically work with my foot issues (supination/underpronation), and he even took the shape of my feet into consideration (wide in front, narrow in the heel). He never tried to talk me into buying anything that I didn't absolutely love, and even discouraged me from buying a pair that was fairly comfortable, but just didn't fit right. (My heel was sliding up and down in the shoe as I walked.) A less reputable salesman would have tried talking me into buying every shoe I tried on, but not Ian. I never felt pressured, and he and the rest of the staff were more than happy to answer any questions I had about the shoes, and later, about other merchandise.\n\nIn the past, I have had a very difficult time finding even one pair of shoes that fit me right. There have been times when I tried on a dozen pairs of shoes at other stores, only to leave without buying anything. But, thanks to the talented staff and advanced fitting techniques at True Runner, I now own TWO PAIRS of SUPER COMFORTABLE and great-fitting hiking/running shoes (Sauconys), and I couldn't be happier. \n\nI've never seen a more professional and knowledgeable staff in any shoe store ever before in my entire life! It was a phenomenal experience. These folks really know how to fit you for the perfect pair of shoes for your feet.\n\nAnd, their 30-day guarantee is the icing on the cake! EVEN IF YOU'VE WORN THE SHOES ON THE STREET, you can still return them for a store credit within 30 days! (Full refund if they haven't been worn outside.) I've never heard of a store letting you return shoes that have been worn on the street. That's how confident they are that they've sold you the right shoes for your feet! \n\nI was also glad to find some much-needed accessories while I was there. In addition to purchasing two pairs of hiking/running shoes, I also bought a really nice insulated water bottle with hand-strap for easy carrying; two stretchy earmuffs that were a perfect fit (my ears get cold easily); a long-sleeved moisture-wicking shirt (dual-function--works for exercise AND hot flashes! LOL.); and two really awesome sun visors. (The earmuffs have a slot built into the back to allow a ponytail to be pulled right through! I love that feature.)\n\nI have to tell you that the young man who waited on me, Ian, was outstanding and went above and beyond the call of duty! As I was checking out, I mentioned how much I liked the white sun visor I'd found on a clearance rack, and that I wished it came in other colors. He went back to the visor display, and promptly returned with the visor I loved in black! I was thrilled, and bought them both--the white and black visors. What makes these visors so special? The back is a very stretchy, lightweight fabric, which makes them easy to put on, extremely comfortable, and will help keep the hair off the back of my neck. (I have my hair in a ponytail when I hike.)\n\nThis was a wonderful shopping experience! This is what shoe-shopping (and accessory-shopping) should always be like. I have found my \""go-to\"" store for all my future hiking and running needs. KUDOS the entire staff for their knowledge, good nature, and attention to detail. My advice: avoid going during crowded times, but if you do, be patient. They're worth the wait. And, if you're not in a hurry, wait for a rainy day to shop. GOOD LUCK & HAPPY SHOPPING!",2
"Let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock P.M. one night, I could not fall asleep until about 3:00 A.M.This brief review may contain spoilers.I'm a long-time fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I've seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, watching over my own father, comatose in the ICU before he passed.The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesman who's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty.By the time ten minutes had gone by, I knew either Tony was dreaming, or I was watching some other show. It wasn't like the normal Sopranos and I loved it.Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or ""Kevin"") looks into the sky at a ""helicopter spotlight"" and we see prodding through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one I just stated.Tony has come out of the coma for only a moment. His boys take A.J. home and Carmella, overcome by stress, breaks down in the hallway: a signature moment in the episode.For the remainder of the episode, we cut in between the real world: the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and Tony's alternate reality, which parallels what's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him.Then comes the stellar point in the episode: after A.J. finishes telling his mother he's flunked school, she walks in to see Meadow sitting at Anthony's side.She approaches Tony, and utters the best line of the episode: ""Anthony, can you hear us?"" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to dial, but he cannot--as if he were trying to say something back to Carmella, but couldn't physically bring himself to do so. Not yet.He sits down and looks out his window. A shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city.""When It's Cold I'd Like To Die"" by Moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster of an episode.10 out of 10.P.S.: Watch the next episode. You find out what the light is. It's wonderful.",2
Needed some filters for our Dyson cleaner. Ordered from espares and they were delivered next day. Easy! Great service,2
"The day before I arrived, I called ahead to ask the manager to save 2 rooms close together for my friend and me. He took my name and number and said he would call right back, he never did. My room was so small I thought it was a joke. There was no closet, but hangers on the lamp. Eventually I was ""upgraded"", and I use that term loosely. This room was right over the nightclub. Five stories up and it felt like the band was in the room. I kept checking to see if the window was open it was so loud. There was no NY or London Times, or L'Occitane products as advertised. The towels were threadbare and looked like something you'd see at the Y. The elevators were very slow.
The location was good, and some of the staff did try. But for the price, I would stay elsewhere.",2

"I don't write reviews, I typically just read them but my family agreed that we needed to take 5 minutes to recognize the staff of the Bookshire. We traveled to Baltimore for my daughter to be treated at Johns Hopkins so it was not a vacation in any sense. In fact, it was quite a difficult situation. The staff was so helpful from the time the taxi dropped us off to when they arranged for a taxi to take us back to the airport. I apologize in advance if the names are wrong but I believe Geff took our luggage from the taxi and waited as we checked in. Denis was welcoming and explained not only the hotel info at checkin but also explained how his shuttle would pick us up and take us to the hospital the next morning. He also made sure we knew what local restaurants would still be open when we returned from the hospital, as we expected it to be very late. David who worked in the breakfast room was a delight and gave us a feeling of being home even though we were 1000 miles away.
Our room was comfortable and clean and the rate we received was very cheap considering the shuttle, breakfast and I happy hour (which we weren't able to enjoy on this visit).
This will be our hotel of choice on subsequent hopsital trips. God bless.",2
"Hotel restaurant? Pssh. Could easily stand on its own. Came in town for a long weekend and friends had recommended Distrito before they even knew we were staying at the Saguaro. Do the guac with crab - sounds odd, but mighty tasty. Margaritas were probably the best we had all weekend - but the Distrito Mule was just as good. And I should mention that we also got - hands down - the best service we've ever had from Keith from Philadelphia. Guy couldn't have been more helpful, friendly and chill. Even drew us a map to the bars we asked him about in Old Town Scottsdale. And made some recommendations based on what we were looking for. So go here. Eat. Drink. Hope you get Keith. And just enjoy it.\n(PS - sat with their chef at Bootleggers later that night. Couldn't have been more down to earth guy, recommended the tortas for our next visit!)",2

With that said, they offer great margaritas.\n\nLove the environment. Modern Mexican, yet comfortable and not pretentious. Great selection of tequila and a staff that knows the menu.",2
"went on wednesday night in march 2014, need to book a table in advance as the place was packed. suitable for younger trendy people. not good for a quiet relax chat with friends. food was not cheap, 65 ringgit for a steak 15 for a juice plus 10%+ service charge. it was a big bar/ restaurant with trendy nightclub feel atmosphere. waitors and waitresses were very friendly and attentive, although the place was packed, there seemed always a staff nearby to attend tables. food was ok, but could be better.",2
App is perfect... but whenever i open a video it play like reel.... that one issue must be solved at earliest.. thanks,2
"I don't know where this movie was shot, but because it was shot on location, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of a young English woman who is taken prisoner by the Japanese in southern Asia at the beginning of WWII, with a group of other English women. There is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place, because the Japanese don't know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of the English women, and the bravery of the Australian soldier who tries to help them, is the core of the movie. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on PBS, as a series, which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from England, across this remote island, and finally Australia. Story, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss. My only question is why this hasn't been released on DVD!",2

"My husband and I stayed here for a night this past weekend. We didn't get to see too much of the hotel since the baseball game we attended went 17 innings! Overall thought this was a nice value and we're sorry we couldn't take advantage of some of the amenities like the rooftop pool and milk and cookies hour. We did love getting a copy of the Sunday New York Times the next morning.
The cons: really inferior house-label bath products, including a hand soap that left behind a slick film that you could not scrub off; displaying a bottle of water like it's complimentary, only to then notice the little hang tag with the $5.50 price; the sink in our bathroom was set a little too far back; the valet parking. Don't bother with the latter. For our Friday stay we paid $10 to park the car 2 blocks from the ballpark (this proximity despite a torrential downpour 30 minutes before the start of the game). We considered leaving the car there overnight, but the traffic cop advised us against it, which was no problem since we found free street parking a block away.",2
Very helpful and excellent service received.,2
"The hotel really exceeded my expectations. From entering the lobby I knew that the hotel would be nice, the decor is lovely throughout.

Staff were helpful and professional at all time. nWill definitely return again",2

"My family spent the Christmas holiday at the Hotel Palomar. I chose it based on the reviews here on trip advisor and the room options available. We stayed in an Executive Suite which has a spacious living room with sleeper sofa and a bedroom with a king bed. The closets are very large (there were 2 in our suite). All of my requests were met upon arrival and, although our view was nothing to brag about, I was happy that it was quiet and comfortable. Everything was perfect at the Hotel Palomar, from the staff members to the wine social hour (love the sparkling wine option) to the continental breakfast on Christmas morning. I was very happy and satisified with my entire stay and hope to stay again sometime in the near future.",2

"""Heartland"" is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier. The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.",2

"If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Furthermore,I thought that the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.In conclusion: Good Characters, Great Plot, Poorly Written/Edited Ending. Still, Go See It!!!",2

I am a first time gun owner who is really scared to buy my first gun. \nAfter finding a gun suited for me I went as far as putting that gun on hold at accuracy gun store. Huge mistake... Not only have they kept me on the phone for 15 mins to ask a question but the sales rep assured me they would be open on Monday (labor day) well that's a lie. 45 min later I find out they are closed a waste of gas and time. Just so happened that a friend convinced me to try discount firearms. Not only did I get great customer service but I also saved 75 dollars on the cost of the gun. \nI'm heading back to accuracy gun shop tomorrow for a refund of my lay away and to tell them what I think of their service.\nPoint of this is wanna save money discount firearms is the way to go. \nGetting another gun from them real soon.,2
i do feel i should have been more ecstatic when i opened my results but i think im getting used to the whole results system after gcses and as so the buzz does wear off a little,2
"good flight ,usual high level of service .Meals were on a par with emirates and much better than Air NZ
the only problem i had i could not book exit row seats as it was a code share ,despite going via Singapore Customer Care this was frustrating as i am 6,3 .Otherwise i did the identiacl trip 4 weeks earlier with Emirates ,the only difference was the A380 is a more roomy plane particulary if you go to the front sector of economy",2
Found them very helpful and very polite,2
"Great dash cam
This dash cam is awesome and perfect! High resolution! Video is clear. Worth it for your money. Highly recommended!",2
this was the best staff i have experienced @ any hotel i have visited special thanks to Conor & Meg..,2
"The train car rooms were fabulous which makes for a truly memorable experience. I had my reservations at first, but this definately beat staying in a traditional hotel room. The rooms were very clean, roomy and had a charm to them. The hotel's location is great; easy to walk to any downtown Indy attraction. I would also recommend the Plaza Hotel restaurant as the food was first class. Overall, a fun experience and I would definately bring the kids back to stay in the train car hotel !!",2
"Great hotel all around. The rooms were really nice, the bed super comfy, the hotel food was excellent and the shower's water pressure was awesome. The courtyard in the middle of the hotel is beautiful. I held my husband's 40th birthday party in the banquet center and everything was perfect. The hotel staff was outstanding and extremely responsive, anticipating my every need. If I were to hold another event in Austin, I would go back to this Doubletree every time.",2
"I saw the film at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully done, from cinematography to the acting. It's the story of a father and son, and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with dialog that never rings false, the film showcases the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding cast. The film begins with the aging father (Peter Falk)is trying to figure out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. The father presents himself, unannounced, on the doorstep of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip. They fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a barroom brawl, and dance with strange women. But more important, they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them.",2
"We stayed here 6 nights, from Saturday 21 April to Friday 27 April. When we come back , we are definitely staying at Le Meridien. It rained upon our arrival as expected, but then the rest of the week was excellent for this time of year.
After several hours of searching, my wife found a deal on Priceline.com for $1035 which included round trip tickets for two from Phoenix to SF, and six nights at the hotel. After checking the hotel out on TripAdvisor and reading the excellent reviews, we took the deal.
The TripAdvisor reviews were very accurate. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and always ready to assist. Housekeeping was superb.
Our hotel room was immaculate, upscale, and in perfect condition with no odors or obvious aberrations. The beautiful bathroom was a spacious 6’x7’ not including the bathtub/shower area. High pressure shower, fast hot water, high quality toiletries. The main room was about 18’x14’, and separated by a wall from the large entryway which included the bathroom entrance and closet area. Our room contained a king-size bed which was very comfortable with numerous and various pillows and a down comforter. We slept in late every morning which is a rarity for me since it I normally get back pain – even on our highly rated mattress. We were pleasantly surprised that this did not occur at all. The room also contained a night stand, desk, coffee table, love seat, single chair and end table. The 27” TV sat in an 8’ long x 4’high center which contained the mini-fridge, mini-safe, and side of drawers. Air conditioning was steady and consistent with little fluctuation.
Half of the outside wall of the room is a floor to ceiling window. The wall protrudes out at an angle so that the glass side of the room juts out 4 feet from the building, and gave us a much better view of the immediate area. It also brightens the room very well. On the down side, you can hear a little bit more noise from the street than you otherwise would (at least in room 517). Considering a fire station is located around the corner on the opposite block, this is significant. Regardless, I much prefer the window than not.
The PPV movie selection was better than normal with many genre’s to choose from including international and art films. Movie prices ranged from $11 to $15, and also included a pre-release sneak preview movie for $23. In the two fortune cookies we received every day during the week , we received a total of 3 free PPV movie coupons.
The hotel is in an excellent location, outside of main tourist areas, but only a few blocks from major transit hubs from which one can easily get anywhere in the city with little effort. Arriving in SF at 10:30pm, we missed the BART coming in from the SF Airport and paid $40 plus tip for a taxi. On the way back we paid $5.15 each for the BART and it was only a few minutes more. During weekday traffic, the BART would actually have been faster. We were here once before about 8-10 years ago when we couldn’t afford to rent a car and found that not only did we not need one, seeing the city was far more enjoyable without one. Due to our location, it was even better this time.
We were able to tap into WiFi hot spots from our room on the 5th floor, but with poor communication speeds. We then opted for the $13 per day WiFi charge (as needed). The internet was an indispensable tool in our exploration of San Francisco in addition to our collection of brochures, maps etc. We highly recommend the $3 transit map that you can purchase in many places.
The fitness center was excellent. Very clean, new, 3 treadmills, 2 recumbents, 3 ellipticals, free weights, universal, fresh fruit, towels, cold water.
We are value oriented but do not sacrifice comfort and quality. We got all three. Next time we come to Frisco, we will not need to search for a place to stay, only the best price.
The EMBARCADERO CENTER is across the street from Le Meridien. Nice place to shop for a short time. They also have an arts cinema. We watched The Black Book which was in Dutch with English subtitles. We suppose the fact that it had subtitles precluded it from mainstream release, but the movie is strictly a first-class suspense thriller with exciting twists and turns, and centers on the resistance in WWII.
With time to burn before the movie started, we ate at Fuzio’s Pasta across from the Cinema. We both shared the Chicken Picatta which was very good.",2
"I stopped by here last night after the Suns game. It was cheap and fast. Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted. It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. \n\nOh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around.",2

"Love it...no complaints. Love the customization, the ability to one particular song, and listening to an artist station that only plays THAT ARTIST and not similar ones too.",2
Everything I've tried is amazing. The owner remembered me the 2nd time in. Super friendly and awesome lemonade with rose water. Def worth trying.,2
"Very easy to use website to get the correct battery. Repeat customer, will definitely use again",2
"This was our second evening at Chelsea's Kitchen. It was outstanding! The tuna tar-tar was amazing. We had the fish tacos and the scallops special - all perfect portions and cooked perfectly. The staff at Chelsea's Kitchen is so pleasant - it makes the evening great. We finished off the evening with the red velvet cake - what a treat. Kate, the assistant manager, was gracious and remembered us from the last time we were there over 2 months ago. Overall - an outstanding evening - great food - great friends - great staff. Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen!!",2
So useful...thanks for the service,2
"Seth is the front desk manager. We've stayed here once a year for the past five years and appreciate the family atmosphere and independent business (i.e. Not like a chain) spirit of the place. I mixed up our reservation. We arrived one night early on an extremely busy weekend and Seth took care of us, never losing his cool. Seth Rocks, thus the name for this review.
Over the years, the owners have steadily been upgrading the rooms one by one. I thought the property looked as good as it's ever been. Windows all clean (not easy on the ocean), freshly painted surfaces. They are really trying.
This time we got room 101, a disabled room. No kitchen but the bathroom was huge (9' x 9') with a walk in shower big enough for two. The room had an oblique ocean view from the chair by the window, too. Finishes were all fairly new. Operable windows.
A bonus this visit was the brand new park visitors center across the street, along with renovated park pathways, parking, restrooms. What an amenity next door! All of it facing the Pacific.
Dining wise we tend to avoid the Cliff House for $$$ and head for Pacific Cafe, Louies, or Seal Rock for breakfast. Have enjoyed them all numerous times. Have also found some good options about 20 blocks east along Geary Street.",2
"Brilliant delivery men , very helpful and polite , put the appliances where I wanted them and gave me some advice on setting up my new tumble drier which I wasn’t told about in the shop",2

"Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. One to enjoy. Gave it a 7 rating. Likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time.For film-noir fans...""The Big Steal"" ""They Live By Night"" ""Side Street"" are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. Bought and viewed. Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way. Some long ago and never forever.",2

"Holy moly, what a breakfast joint! I was in Vegas on vacation and wanted a good local place to fill up in the morning. So I Yelped around and found this place. Went there not really knowing what to expect (other than \""it better live up to all these fantastic reviews!\"") and we were blown away!\n\nWe were looking at the menu trying to figure out the place when the neighbor table got their order. We were all dumbstruck! The plates are huge. But not just huge for size sake, but yummy stacked atop more yummy. \n\nI wish there was a place like that back home... but I am happy to have gone to say that I had the experiencing of eating at one special breakfast joint!",2
"Have been looking for a good deli around the office for quite some time now, decided to let Yelp help me and low and behold this is what I found. This is the real deal, freshly prepared sandwiches that are too die for! Plus a variety of fresh sausages, meats etc. Will be making this a once a week lunch run for sure! Try the #14!",2
"After checking my bag in, I remembered I had left my epilepsy medication in this bag. Upon notifying the staff they were excellent in retrieving my bag & going thru the process of getting me back into the flight lounge. Very professional & will definitely fly with them again. Great service on the flight both ways.",2
"Paris, JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love, a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing. Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film. Tied together by each of the sectors or Arrondissement of the city, the film examines love in all forms, native folk in their Parisian modes, and tourists interacting with the great city. Approximately twenty writers and directors, each with about five minutes of screen time, include Olivier Assayas, the Coen Brothers, Sylvain Chomet, Isabel Coixet, Wes Craven, ALfonso Cuarón, Gérard Depardieu, Christopher Doyle, Vincenzo Natali, Alexander Payne, Walter Salles, Nobuhiro Suwa, and Gus Van Sant among others less well known. The stories vary from hilarious, to humorous, to touching, to tragic, to banal, to tender.In one story a young Frenchman (Gaspard Ulliel) is attracted to a young lithographer (Elias McConnell), pouring out his heart in French to a lad who speaks only English. In another a separated husband and wife (Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara) meet in the Latin Quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in Père-Lachaise (Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed Oscar Wilde intervenes. Steve Buscemi in Tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections, in Bastille Sergio Castellitto (in love with mistress Leonor Watling) is ready to divorce his wife Miranda Richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia, Juliette Binouche confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in Place des Victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy Willem Defoe, Sara Martins and Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in Parc Monceau, Fanny Ardant and Bob Hoskins 'play out' a strange relationship in Pigalle, Melchior Beslon plays a young blind man to actress Natalie Portman in learning how to see in Faubourg Saint-Denis, vampire love between Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko in Quartier de la Madeleine, Maggie Gyllenhaal is an ex-patriot actress stung out on drugs in Quartier des Enfants Rouges, and Margo Martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the French she has studied for her life's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème Arrondissement.The final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible, but this only works on superficial levels. The film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories, a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action. But it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re-visit like a scrapbook of a time in Paris. It is a film worth seeing multiple times! Grady Harp",2
"(There isn't much in the way of spoilers, since there isn't a plot to reveal, but still, I guess I describe some of what happens so...) This is it. This is THE most nonsensical film I've ever seen. There are simply no words to describe this movie, although ""bizarre"" ""ridiculous"" and ""ego trip"" are pretty close. the opening half hour or so are really, really weird music videos, with absolutely no plot or continuity, apart from that MJ falls into some from the previous. One of the highlights of this part of the ""film"" in the section where MJ is flying a merry-go-round aeroplane through what seem to be half-arsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from Yellow Submarine (dear lord you could not make this up).Then, with a little over an hour remaining, the ""film"" begins, with a lot of claymation (some of it really creepy) spotting our ""hero"" and chasing him looking for an autograph. Obviously, this leaves our as of yet mute (discounting songs) lead somewhat worried, and he manages to temporarily lose them. Fortunate for him, because it means he can witness a falling star and, and again, I'm not making this up, turn into a claymation rabbit. He uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them, but, for reasons I can't recall right now, they see through it (oh no!) and the creepy chase begins again. Cue another song (big shock there).Shortly after the end of the chase, MJ somehow brings the rabbit to life, until he is busted by a policeman (in the middle of the desert) because it is, apparently, illegal to dance there.The rest of the film is equally as strange, highlights including MJ cleaning up a bar to the tune of Smooth Criminal, including shooting a man with his finger, not only killing the guy, but burning his shadow into the wall, a la nuclear fission weapons. Another good moment is when MJ, seeing, Mr Big (Joe ""what the hell happened to his career at this point?"" Peschi) kidnap one of the children he was friends with, magically creates a tommy gun, and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random, opens fire at everything that moves. A final moment I shall mention is when MJ, surrounded by Mr Big and his private army. Seriously, this guy has dozens of people working for him, and they're decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters, which I guess they are. How does he get out? Why, he turns into a robot, complete with weapons and shield. This is the third of four transformations he makes, almost always when backed into a corner and/or on the run.This film is quite, quite surreal, with little in the way of plot, and virtually no continuity.",2
im going to give this one a and really i feel like im being generous here,2
MJ is amazing! This is the only place I will go for a spray tan. I met MJ during my wedding plan and continue to be thrilled every time I see her. The tans always look natural and last an average of 5 days. Her staff is just as sweet and knowledgeable as MJ herself in making sure I get exactly the look I am going for. The customer service is friendly and the studio is adorable and comfortable. She is great to work with to get in for a tan and I always leave happy and tan. Couldn't recommend MJ and her team enough.,2

"We stayed in the Inn at the start of a 3 week vacation and it was probably the best hotel we stayed in. The loaction in the heart of Pike Place market is fantastic for the first time visitor, and we've never had so much great fresh food on our doorstep before. The reception area was warm, peacefull and welcoming, and always had bowl of fresh cookies out every afternoon.
The hotel isnt a moden statement of cutting edge design, but it fits in perfectly with its surrounding, and has a sophisticated, relaxing, and friendly ambiance. We did have a problem overly loud air conditioning in the room, but this was our only issue. Other than that the rooms were spacious, well designed, had great views, and were an unexpected highlight.",2

"I found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese. It becomes a story about values, and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life, and loyalties toward institutions. Amazingly enough, it managed to do this in a gentle, mildly humorous manner, which only in retrospect seens threatening to one's status quo. I enjoyed the movie, and would watch it again if I could.",2

The Brown Palace is a hotel that exemplifies luxury and comfort. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the attention to detail in style and cleanliness is impeccable.

"Though I have stayed all over the world, and in many of the finer hotels throughout the US, I have never taken the time to post a review about a hotel (or anything else for the matter). You may ask, why now? The answer is simple. The W in Austin was amazing. Start to finish the staff and facilities surpassed my expectations. Perhaps one of the best messages I've ever had. I work across from the W in Hollywood and Austin kills them. The W Austin has a friendly, attractive staff. Nicole, one of the hotel's concierge enhanced the value of my stay tenfold. She went out of her way to provide a litany of amazing ideas for activities, food, and nightlife. Location, location, location...The location was perfect. Everything is in walking distance and the W's bars are attractions themselves.",2

At that point we were exhausted and starving from being at the water park and Freddy's was AWESOME food.\n\nOne day I thought hey, I wonder if they have any Freddy's out West and found the one on Bell Road. We loaded up the SUV and drove from Gilbert to Glendale AND the drive was worth it!

"I absolutely love this place. I live in north Tempe and I drive 20 minutes here because they are the BEST. The family that runs the place is so very nice, and the remember you by name from the first time you come in. Sometimes nail salons can be a little sketchy with cleanliness, but this place is spotless-I mean really, it's like you could eat off of the floor. They take walk ins, which is really nice. The gel manicures they give me last for weeks even though I regularly swim at the gym and generally abuse my hands. The pedicures last equally as long, and I've always gotten a great coat of polish. Be aware that they only accept tips in cash, but they do such a great job that you will want to tip them well. They offer manicures, pedicures, gel polish, waxing and a variety of other services. If you need a nail salon, come here-even if it's a drive. You won't regret it!",2

"When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one. Think that, and you will truly enjoy the film (because you'll rid yourself of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) BOTTOM LINE: Watch the movie, and have fun, but don't look for anything groundbreaking.",2
Really enjoyed this hotel. The service can be summed up by when I called the front desk to ask if I could borrow a bottle opener. The man there said he had one on his personal key chain and would be right up to my room. He was there in 2 minutes! Rooms were nice and clean and we enjoyed the late night pool and hot tub. Could walk to 16th St in about 10 minutes for plenty to do!,2
The Ads can be annoying but it's the best app so far for listening to music and if you do get the it's the best for downloading and you get a family plan but in my experience with all the music has been good so far that and podcasts are good as well-w- & is easy to use as well no difficult or complicated things or steps to do also kid friendly and safe,2

"This movie has become an iconic stand-in for what is great about America. Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standout actors, singers, and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara*, and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant, sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances.The film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians,dancers, & score by Christopher Gore. A wonderment to behold. * An interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented Anne Meara ... sometimes talent must reside in the genes ... Ms. Meara is married to one Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller ...",2

"Travelled Dragonair from Hanoi-HKG and back 20th and 31st December 2015, respectively. Airbus 321. Extremely alert staff, caring, pro-active, energetic, and professional. Food and wines of unexpected high quality and tasteful for economy class. 4 different kinds of beers offered – all from different countries. Elite card holder recognition by FA staff - even from other OW-airlines than Cathay and Dragonair. Only a minor delay of 30 minutes prevents me from rating the airline to 10 of 10 as delays are common according to their own information provided on their website, which is very good. Clear information on everything and willingness to expose their weak point, delays, is appreciated. Return flight was full on New Years’ eve, but well managed. A minor fault occurred by FAs mistakenly providing someone else “my” child meal. However, it was elegantly made up for by staff apologizing and personally displaying three alternatives for us by presenting them all on a tray, opening the foil. Drink rounds frequent and gentle.",2

"Having read so much negative press on this movie over the years, I'd always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally give it a viewing. Unfortunately, it's been transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, shot on tinted stock, is blurry and the contrast, non-existent. Faces are occasionally difficult to make out. Having said that, the actual story is entertaining and Lou comes across as an accomplished actor, more so than in many of the boys' movies.Once the movie switches to the 'Jack' story, the film switches to 'colour' and I use that term loosely. Most hues are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad.Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the giant's maid, was a big plus for me as I enjoyed her in an early 'Andy Hardy' appearance.With so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It gave me a lot of laughs and that's more than the greater majority of comedies I've watched over the decades can manage.One to watch if you get the chance.",2

Discovered dessert. Yuzu pannacotta. Soooo good. A great end to a \nWonderful meal. Love love it.,2
"Loved it. booked through hot-wire, and no you don't get a special condescending service because of that. the lady at the reception was extremely friendly and nice, and she even got me a room in the new tower (superior) where the rooms are new or renovated. i got a room on the 19th floor with breathtaking views over Boston. the breakfast was extremely expensive though. The room was very nice, huge, and renovated.",2
"I initially booked for 3 nights at this hotel but decided to extend for 4 more nights because of the location and the great advance booking rate I got ($99/night). True enough, the location of the hotel is great! Shopping is so convenient plus the hop-on-hop-off buses stops in front of Macy's which is just three streets away from the hotel. The cable car at Powell street is also nearby (only two streets from the hotel) so going to Fisherman's Wharf area is not a problem.",2
Easy to contact & first class customer service,2
We had a great experience at the Embassy Suites in La Jolla. Our room and bathroom were really clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was quiet and we enjoyed the hot made-to-order breakfast. We were really happy with the location. A terrific hotel at an affordable price with a lot of amenities. We will definitely stay there again.,2
"I'm in love with Fresh Mint! This place is amazing. And I'm NOT a vegetarian!! We had a gift certificate so we went all out and tried lots of different options on our first visit. I'll give you the scoop, but for a quick snapshot -here's the deal: \n-super affordable, meals between $5-10.\n-generous portions\n-delicious & flavorful foods (Kung Pao!) \n-friendly staff\n-casual environment \n\nFirst up: Fresh summer rolls and Green Papaya salad. The spring rolls were beautiful. Wow! They had a little more lettuce than I personally prefer, but the taste was still great. The papaya salad was delicious. It was not spicy at all, and I will probably ask for a little more spice or peanut sauce on the side next time, but it was so flavorful it still hit the spot. Two of us shared this dish and I still took home enough for another meal the next day - definitely good for sharing. \n\nNext course: Pho / Five Spice Noodle Soup. This dish amazed me. A little sweet, so savory and rich flavored. Tasted like homemade beef pho. My family has Pho for Christmas each year - this definitely could be in the running for my favorite Pho! \n\nEntrees: Upon recommendations from our server, we chose the Pad Thai & the Kung Pao dishes. Both were generous portions and bursting with flavor. They are also just beautifully plated. I like my Pad Thai with a little more kick, so would request that next time around. The Kung Pao was PERFECT! I highly, highly recommend this dish. \n\nDessert: Well, as if we hadn't had enough yet - we let ourselves get talked into the chocolate cake. Oh my! It was a delicacy! This massive slice of chocolatey goodness was a 4 or 5 layer cake with a fruity filling (strawberry or raspberry?), a creme layer, another chocolate creme layer and a fabulous icing. It was quite decadent. \n\nVietnamese iced coffee and lemonade were also enjoyed! \n\nWe took home 4 to go boxes (papaya salad, pad thai, kung pao, and chocolate cake!), so the portions are definitely generous. The food was not heavy so we left feeling satisfied. \n\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. The prices were so affordable, this is definitely a place that can be a regular go-to spot! LOVE this place!",2
"Hotel is a half block south of Beltline Road, Addison Texas. Resturant row Addison style is on Beltline Road. Many places to eat, drink and watch games. Hotel staff was attentive. Had two rooms, one had issues with the air conditioner/heat knob, the other room was fine. Not fancy, but was clean. Only two floors so, easy access to each with stairs and elevator. Try to stay on the second floor given a choice. Free WIFI worked fine.",2
"This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE!! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS!!! In parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,I have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way!",2
"This is a great place for Chinese food. I went inside and everything I ate was fantastic( though the only problem was the loud mixer whenever a person orders a smoothie). Something I ate was Xiao long bao which was juicy and soft. The beef noodle soup was fine. Spicy grilled lamb skewer was good ,but set my mouth on fire. Pork and bok choy dumplings were so good that I didn't spare a single one. Over all this Chinese restaurant is a place that you should go to.",2
"We had an excellent 5 night stay here in August. The staff were very friendly and helpful checking us in despite our slightly vague post flight state! We were there for our anniversary and the bottle of champagne in our room was a great way to start our holiday! We had a wonderful room on the 15th floor with a fabulous view over midtown and we loved it. The a/c was quite noisy but offered such sweet relief from the NY August heat it was worth it! Both the bedroom and bathroom were huge, with the bed comfortable and the bathroom clean.
The rooftop bar is a great venue and worth a visit for the sunset view but it was a little too trendy for us to spend much time there! We only used the restaurant for breakfast - it was pricey but the food was excellent and the service brilliant.
We quite liked the location - the easy access from the West Side Highway meant cabs back from Soho and the Village were quick and inexpensive.
We'll definitely stay here again when we're back in NYC.",2

i mean working in the same place for a while and stuff and the third time it started to feel like a really valuable soul connection between us and it really seemed like there was something wanting to happen between us but i let my insecurities get the better of me and i think she did too,2
Love this place! I usually order the mushroom party pizza add egg or roasted corn pizza add egg. So good! One time I ordered take out from LGO and the egg wasn't cooked on the pizza properly and I just called them and they said the next pizza was on them and it was. Great service. I will keep continuing to return!\n\nPS Kale Salad is also really good as well as the Cheeseburger on the english muffin!,2
"Easy in your pocket, but great gothic accents set
With Halloween around the corner, this gothic set is just what I was looking for. It will compliment my attire, dark but tasteful. I plan to use it for the ""Day of the Death"" parade also. Great value for my money, and cute as it can be. Not a high end product, but perfectly balanced in the looks and pretty well made. It will be a perfect gift for any gothic fan.",2
"Let me begin by saying we had another very nice stay at this hotel. The rooms are still small but great and the staff is very friendly and accomodating. If you are a smoker and insist on a smoking room you would be better off trying another hotel. I had reserved my smoking King room 2 months previously. Upon arrival alas there were no smoking rooms. Evidently Hilton removed a bunch of smoking floors and, of course, did not let their smoking guests know about this. There is now 1 floor that is smoking with 14 rooms on it. That means 14 out of 569 rooms are smoking rooms. Even if you book one of these rooms you are not guaranteed to get one as per the Manager of the hotel told me. The odds are pretty bad. Otherwise it's still a fine hotel. This review is just a caution to the 22% of Americans who smoke.",2

"This is a lovely, spirit-restoring movie. From the use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.",2
Uhm.... Hands down 5 stars. BEST Thai food I've ever had in AZ! I wouldn't recommend just one item... I would recommend trying ALL of them.

I am so glad it didn't.for if it had I am scared my phone would be forever stuck in a time loop.",2
Solid restaurant with good food options and a nice view of the park,2
"The elevator is very slow to arrive; long, confusing, warren like halls double loaded with tiny rooms, it could be a catastrophe in a fire; my room was approx 120 square feet; view from narrow window is a brick wall, apporx 12' away; no desk, no chair; internet is ""free"" but hard to get on -- you get repeated message that too many other guests are using it; light irritatingly shines under door due to bad carpentry in installing threshold, door shudders each time air pressure changes in corridor from others opening and closing their doors. No breakfast, only coffee in lobby, but no decaf.
More positively, friendly staff, rooms recently renovated. Great location. But I would not return. Spend a little more if you must, but skip the Belleclaire.",2

"I travel through Philadelphia frequently and find a need for a hotel between flights. I found the hotel fits my needs and the price is right. Many reviews state that it needs an update. The halls are indeed in need of a face lift. My room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was good, but running out of things as I waited till the end to go downstairs and it was bursting at the seams. The front desk treats you as if you are the only guest and they are there for your every need. Another guest was looking for the apple store the desk clerk quickly found where it was and called a taxi company to find out what the fare would be there and back. I consider this to be over and above what a desk clerk usually does, kudos to that employee. I have had trouble before with the shuttle service with other hotels in Philadelphia airport area and found them to be sadly disappointing. You can depend on their shuttle service and as with every other employee of this hotel, the driver was a total delight, plus offered me a bottle of water for the drive. Do not let the need for an update of the common area stop you from staying at this great hotel that truly knows the meaning of customer serv",2

If you call ahead they will make sure you have gluten free chips for you too. Great food and good service! I have celiac disease and felt very safe eating there.",2
Great stay at Andra - taxi driver told me this is where Amazon outs many of their business travellers up. Rooms are very well sized with pleasing decor and furniture - service was exceptional. Ideal location - definitely would recommend for business or pleasure travel!,2
Had our dinner here tonight. First experience of Malay food in Melacca. Had pie tee for a starter - very tasty. The beef rendang was tender with just the right amount of spiceyness and served with rice and various condiments. My wife had the laksa which was way to big for her to eat but the flavours were spot on. Had the sago with coconut cream and gula to finish the meal - loved it too. Will definately make a return visit before we leave and highly recommend.,2
"I have been travelling for more than 35 yrs. from Boston to St. Thomas to San Francisco to Seattle, and I can honestly say that this Inn is at the very top of my list. The accomodations are top notch and the staff is exceptionally attendant to your needs! Additionally, it's a great value & I have no qualms whatsoever refferring all to this establishment when in San Antonio!",2
"We spent 4 nights here in mid-November and had an excellent experience. I've stayed in six or seven hotels in SF and this ranks with the top of the boutiques. The service was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. Join the Kimpton frequent stay club (forget what it's called) and get a free daily paper and personalized treatment. the hotel is close to Chinatown, Union Square, and the Embarcadero. Even better it is only a block and a half from the Montgomery St. BART station and thus only about 40 minutes total from SFO or OAK. Skip the breakfast coffee for the many bakeries in the area (but not the one right next door) but the wine hour (5:30-6:30) is definitely worthwhile.",2
"The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and wasn't intended to be a sequel to Demons as Lamberto Bava even mentions it on the interview on the Sheirk Show DVD, but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror Demons III: The Ogre is a architectural horror so that's how Demons III isn't a proper sequel to Demons but I still like this film.The music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in, The Ogre is another thing why I like the film. There are two other films that are classed as Demons III and that is Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with Demons and Demons 2.",2

And for dessert, it isn't even a question: you have to try the butter cake if you have not had it before. When I am in Scottsdale, I can't go to another steakhouse; I'm ruined forever.",2

"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Copley Place from April 17-19, 2008, and we had no problems. Check in was prompt and the staff was nice. The room was average size, deluxe king room, had Starbucks coffee, but we don't drink coffee, and the room was very clean. It is in a GREAT location for shopping, restaurants, and the subway. It is a $10.00 cab ride, one way, to Fenway Park or it is a 5 minute subway ride to the Park. Overall we had a nice stay. The only thing I can think that would be negative were the stains on the carpet outside of the elevators, but not that big of a deal. Would stay there again. There is a mall that is attached to this hotel just in case you need to go shopping for anything. Its is connected by a covered walkway. Fabulous idea!!!
Happy Traveling!
P.S. The only reason we went to Boson was to see Fenway Park and see the Red Sox play :)",2

"We were at the Palazzo for the Grand Opening weekend for my friend's Bachelorette party and it's EXACTLY like the Venetian. The rooms are super spacious (about 700 sq. feet) and in addition to the \""bedroom\"" area, there's the little living room space that has an L shaped couch, desk, etc. Super NEW....everything smelled brand new and I didn't feel gross walking around without shoes. \n\nThe casino is also really clean - although there was this smell that resembled the smell of a stink bomb that we kept smelling. Wasn't sure if we were just trippin or not. \n\nWe ate at the cafe/restaurant there (The Lux....I think)....reminded me of Cheesecake Factory - extensive menu list and so did the ambiance. Very reasonable prices too. \n\nOne thing that sucked, was that we were debating whether or not to play craps before or after lunch.....so we figured they wouldn't raise the minimum ($10) to anything higher within the next hour or so. BUT THEY DID...raised it to $15 by 3pm. OH well...",2
food very delicious especially the lala。。。i love it😘,2
"That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director. Please see it if you do have an opportunity.",2

"I haven't been to Texas in years. But maybe a trip to Allison's Texas BBQ is close enough! Eating barbecue like this is a very special culinary treat. I'm a wee bit grateful it's not too close to me. Otherwise I'd be eating my way out of my leggings. Dangerous!\n \nLocated in a nondescript shopping center (With copious amounts of signage! Can't be missed) the restaurant is sensible in design. Old school booths line the walls and tables fill the rest. Checkered plastic table cloths add character along with the decided Texas accents. (e.g.Texas flags, cowboy signs.)\n\nLooking at the menu my friend and I weren't quite sure what to order. The delightful smell of barbecue wasn't helping. (We were hAngry! It smelled good in there!) Lynn, the manager, suggested we go with the \""Big Tex\"" and add onto it. Normally it comes with 3 meats. We upgraded to 4 meats and a small orders of all the sides for $24. So that would be 4 Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken *and* [deep breath] Corn Souffle, King Ranch Beans, Hill Country Potato Salad, Cole Slaw. \n\nIt was mm-mm-mm finger licking good! The star in the sides by a stretch was the Corn Souffle. My friend said, \""If I could, I would eat this day and night.\"" We plastic fork battled over this one. In the meat section I was a fan of all of them. Ribs! Falling off the bone. Chicken! Moist. Pulled Pork! Yes Please! Brisket! Definitely. \n\nIt's hard to describe enjoying something in words so others can appreciate. With so many options in front of me my biggest issue was the diminishing size of my stomach. \n\nMy friend and I lightly tasted the pecan pie and chocolate sheet cake. Perfect amount of sweet after gorging ourselves on lunch. However, we couldn't possibly eat everything. \n\nA trip to Mesa is worth it! Note there is no alcohol or BYOB. Come prepared to eat! In bulk! Eat here. Your belly will thank you!",2
"Our 2nd stay at Hotel Tomo was as enjoyable and trouble-free as our first. The Japantown location is calm and walking-friendly.
Our room was clean and cozy, with nice clean white bedspreads and pillow cases. The in-room refrigerator was handy, as was the Keurig coffee maker (stocked daily with 2 regular and decaf coffee packs).
The front desk was always staffed with at least one and usually two friendly and attentive staffers. My son loved that there was always a bowl of candy at the front desk.
The on-site parking is a lifesaver in San Francisco, even at $25 a night. One night the garage was full but there were several street spots close by, and we were able to get back into the garage the next morning.
The hotel is clearly comfortable with international visitors; I heard several different languages spoken by guests, and I saw a front desk person patiently explain a phone-system question to a guest who didn't speak much English.
The big flat-panel TV got lots of channels, and the free wi-fi worked fine. And when we had a piece of jewelry slip down the bathroom sink drain (whoops), a maintenance person came in less than 10 minutes to successfully retrieve it.
Our family looks forward to a third Hotel Tomo stay down the road, we'll sure be back.",2

The Hotel is very nice for El Paso but I had a complaint and it was delt with poorly. I have stayed here before and no promblems surfaced but this trip there was no hot water and the tv did not work properly I had to purchase movies at fifteen dollars a pop and they were in and out of static. I let the front desk clerk know and she did not even get me a manager or offer some kind of compensation instead she comented that there were no other complaints and that I should have called in the middle of the night to switch rooms which is also an inconvience.,2
Ordered my office supplies and they were delivered to my door and 1 day sooner then expected. I was surprised and impressed. Great printing supplier.,2

My son is really enjoying his Play tent. I was nervous to put together by myself but it was pretty easy to assemble. He really enjoyed the little mini projector that came with it and loved shining it on the tent to see the pictures. It was also very easy to take apart the tent and store in bag which made me happy. I loved that everything fit back easily in the back. Can’t wait to see this up In the backyard during summer nights.",2
"I booked this hotel based on a previous visit to NYC when I stayed at another property and went for a walk around the neighbourhood. I saw this hotel and looked into it and decided to book it for my next trip. It was an excellent choice! We were a party of 3, and the hotel upgraded us to a room with 3 beds for no extra charge when we checked in! We didn't mind that there was scaffolding on the building (when isn't there, in NYC?) but we had a tiny view of the Empire State Building so we were happy. The room was comfortable enough, the 3rd bed was in a separate room which we were delighted by since our 3rd member snores. It was warm, but the A/C worked well. They have elevators, which are notoriously slow in Manhattan so this didn't bother us too much. Absolutely no problem with bedbugs, in fact it was supremely clean and quiet on our floor. Good water pressure in the shower. Loved it! The breakfast was minimal (muffins, coffee) but we were up early and didn't really need it. There are vending machines on a different level if you need it. They store bags for free (but you should tip them for the service!). The staff was great, no issues. They made our stay memorable. I cannot find fault with this hotel, and hope to stay there again. Reasonable rates I hope will never change!",2

"ANA has one of the best business class seats that offer a lot of privacy and comfort. Even for a tall European of 1.85m the seat is long enough to find a comfortable sleeping position. Flight attendants are outstandingly friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or robotic, and from my experience they all speak very good English. Food quality was above average, but although the flight from Tokyo to Sydney is 9.5 hours, main meal service comes on one tray with appetizer and entree served at the same time, which I find not really reasonable. I found breakfast on this route rather bland and meagre, but flight attendants are happy to find some add-ons, e.g. a left-over cheese plate or so. Inflight entertainment is generally OK, but falls behind Singapore Airlines or Qatar in terms of choice of movies or music, at least the European/Western selection, they might have a better selection for Japanese, Korean, or Chinese taste.",2

"What can I say about this movie except that it is great fun!John Cusack plays Hoops McCann a recent High School graduate who has two choices, learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at Nantucket with his pal George Calamari (played hilariously by Joel Murray) and his zany friends.When I say zany, believe me, it can't get much zanier than the Stork brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw in a little girl named Squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by Demi Moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing, movie.The laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line, though the typical good versus bad and good conquers, is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown.I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time.

During check-in the associate was on the phone the entire time she was checking me in. I got up to my room which was small but clean and started to unpack. As I was unpacking I noticed there was no ironing board in the room. I was heading out for some sightseeing and stopped by the front desk to ask for an ironing board to be brought to my room and the clerk started arguing with me that there was already one in the room. I explained to her that I just looked and it's not there but she wouldn't listen. I walked back up to my room via the stairs (don't bother with the elevator - takes to long) and double checked the closet where she said the ironing board would be. After confirming there was not an ironing board I called down and asked for one to be brought up. She was fairly rude on the phone as well but the ironing board was delivered to my room. I didn't stand all the way up and was hard to close but it got the job done.
There is construction going on next door that is very loud and starts before 8am – this was not a problem for me because I was up and getting ready to head out but if you wanted to sleep in that would not be possible.
I only had breakfast at the hotel one time and I did not like to boiled eggs
The cleaning staff did a great job and I had fresh towels daily.
Free wifi with a great signal in the room
I probably would not stay again as there are many other hotels in the area and the front desk staff is rude.",2

It’s been 3 years since my last flight after my pregnancy and childbirth. I was so looking forward to my ride after so long. It was my son’s first flight to Bangkok. The experience truly never disappoint. The airline managed to surprise my husband with an wedding anniversary cake on our flight there. My son enjoyed his plane ride so much that he keeps asking when our next journey will be. And the airline surprised us with another cake on our flight back to Singapore. What a great celebration trip it was for us!,2

I love this place. \nFree improv workshops and then a show every Sunday. Beginners and seasoned performers are welcome.\nLots of other performers put on all kinds of shows there - usually comedy based but not always. The vibe is simply awesome!!,2
"Wasn't sure we could do all three shops so sent a FB msg to the store. We had a response in under 12 hours ( really good given I posted outside normal work hours) which explained the pros and cons and which ones to try. Happy to say we made the trek to #3 and the staff were great, the store had lots of cool figurines for all budgets and a great range of comics from the very latest to some graded material. It was nice to walk into a comic store that wasn't dingy, nor did it have overly nerdy staff make you feel unwelcome. The guy that served us was polite, helpful, knew his stuff and didn't freak out at have kids in the store. Which was good as they spent their $ too.",2
I like buying stuff at Plugin Boutique,2
"Great food, service, and atmosphere! The staff loves kids! I recommend the chicken burger on pretzel bun and the beer-b-que wings!",2
"Fantastic course that gives not just a great background and techniques in machine learning, but also very hands on skills. I liked the programming exercises most because it was the most clear signal confirming a clear and detailed understanding of the subject to run the code successfully, Thank you Prof. Ng, you are a great teacher.",2
